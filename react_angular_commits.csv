This improved browser support for the `wheel` event.

 - Try to use `wheel` event (DOM Level 3 Specification).
 - Fallback to `mousewheel` event.
 - Fallback to `DOMMouseWheel` (older Firefox).

Also, since `wheel` is the standard event name, let's use that in React.

NOTE: The tricky part was detecting if `wheel` is supported for IE9+ because `onwheel` does not exist.

Test Plan:
Execute the following in the console on a page with React:

  var React = require('React');
  React.renderComponent(React.DOM.div({
    style: {
      width: 10000,
      height: 10000
    },
    onWheel: function() {
      console.log('wheel');
    }
  }, null), document.body);

Verified that mousewheel events are logged to the console.
Verified in IE8-10, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.

Input controls require `ngModel` which in turn brings in the `ngModelOptions`
but since ngModel does this initialization in the post link function, the
order in which the directives are run is relevant.

Directives are sorted by priority and name but `ngModel`, `input` and `textarea`
have the same priority. It just happens that `textarea` is alphabetically
sorted and so linked before `ngModel` (unlike `input`).

This is a problem since inputs expect `ngModelController.$options`
to exist at post-link time and for `textarea` this has not happened.

This is solved easily by moving the initialization of `ngModel` to the
pre-link function.

The new prepare class is added before the animation is pushed to the
queue and removed before the animation runs, i.e. it is immediately
available when a structural animation (enter, leave, move)
is initialized.

The class can be used to apply CSS to explicitly hide these elements
to prevent a flash of content before the animation runs.
This can happen if a structural animation (such as ng-if) sits at the
bottom of a tree which has ng-class animations on the parents.
Because child animations are spaced out with requestAnimationFrame,
the ng-enter class might not be applied in time, so the ng.if element is
briefly visible before its animation starts.

This commit refactors how the search index is built. The docsSearch service
is now defined by a provider, which returns a different implementation of
the service depending upon whether the current browser supports WebWorkers
or now.

* **WebWorker supported**: The index is then built and stored in a new worker.
The service posts and receives messages to and from this worker to make
queries on the search index.

* **WebWorker no supported**: The index is built locally but with a 500ms
delay so that the initial page can render before the browser is blocked as
the index is built.

Also the way that the current app is identified has been modified so we can
slim down the js data files (pages-data.js) to again improve startup time.

This moves all logic around legacy descriptors to ReactLegacyDescriptor. This
is responsible for the layer that knows that createClass exports a legacy
factory. When passed one of these classes, it unwraps it to be a real class.

If it is passed a non legacy factory, it is assumed to be a non-react component
that needs to be invoked as a plain function.

The semantic change is that a descriptor is now always returned if passed a
legacy factory. Even if that factory is a mock. A mock would previously return
undefined.

For mocks, I treat the factory as the authoritative function. I call it to extract
the instance or fill it with an empty component placeholder.

Additionally, I make the classes take props as the first argument to the
constructor. This is what the new class system will do.

We currently need to set up some internals by calling the internal construct
method. Instead of doing that automatically in the constructor, I now move that
to a second pass so that mocks can get the plain props.

This means that we can assert that a mock has been called once it's mounted
with it's final props. Instead of the descriptor factory being called.

Summary:
Currently, `ReactClass` mutates values returned by `getDefaultProps`, `getInitialState`, and `getChildContext`. This is bad because the objects may, for example, be cached and re-used across instances of a React component.

This changes `ReactClass` to instead create a new object. In return for allocating a new object, I've replaced `mapObject` with a `for ... in` so that we are no longer allocating an unused object.

Fair trade, IMO.

Ran unit tests successfully:

```
npm run jest
```

When the pattern and ng-pattern attributes are used with an input element
containing a ngModel directive then they should both use the same validator
and the validation errors of the model should be placed on model.$error.pattern.

BREAKING CHANGE:

If an expression is used on ng-pattern (such as `ng-pattern=""exp""`) or on the
pattern attribute (something like on `pattern=""{{ exp }}""`) and the expression
itself evaluates to a string then the validator will not parse the string as a
literal regular expression object (a value like `/abc/i`).  Instead, the entire
string will be created as the regular expression to test against. This means
that any expression flags will not be placed on the RegExp object. To get around
this limitation, use a regular expression object as the value for the expression.

    //before
    $scope.exp = '/abc/i';

    //after
    $scope.exp = /abc/i;

1) Select the text of the draggable span by clicking outside the span and dragging the mouse to the left or right through the span. Release the mouse button.
2) Now click on the span's inner text, and start to Drag it. The browser's default functionality that drags highlighted text so that it can be pasted into something else (say a document in a text editor) is invoked.
3) Release the mouse button. Now suddenly, you'll be dragging the span. But you won't be able to place it down on the page. It'll just follow the mouse around until the page is refreshed.

In Safari 7 (and other browsers potentially using the latest YARR JIT library)
regular expressions are not always executed immediately that they are called.
The regex is only evaluated (lazily) when you first access properties on the `matches`
result object returned from the regex call.

In the case of `decodeEntities()`, we were updating this returned object, `parts[0] = ''`,
before accessing it, `if (parts[2])', and so our change was overwritten by the result
of executing the regex.

The solution here is not to modify the match result object at all. We only need to make use
of the three match results directly in code.

Developers should be aware, in the future, when using regex, to read from the result object
before making modifications to it.

There is no additional test committed here, because when run against Safari 7, this
bug caused numerous specs to fail, which are all fixed by this commit.

Move responsibility for pending and debouncing model updates into `NgModelController`.
Now input directives are only responsible for capturing changes to the input element's
value and then calling `$setViewValue` with the new value.

Calls to `$setViewValue(value)` change the `$viewValue` property but these changes are
not committed to the `$modelValue` until an `updateOn` trigger occurs (and any related
`debounce` has resolved).

The `$$lastCommittedViewValue` is now stored when `$setViewValue(value)` updates
the `$viewValue`, which allows the view to be ""reset"" by calling `$rollbackViewValue()`.

The new `$commitViewValue()` method allows developers to force the `$viewValue` to be
committed through to the `$modelValue` immediately, ignoring `updateOn` triggers and
`debounce` delays.

BREAKING CHANGE:

This commit changes the API on `NgModelController`, both semantically and
in terms of adding and renaming methods.

* `$setViewValue(value)` -
This method still changes the `$viewValue` but does not immediately commit this
change through to the `$modelValue` as it did previously.
Now the value is committed only when a trigger specified in an associated
`ngModelOptions` directive occurs. If `ngModelOptions` also has a `debounce` delay
specified for the trigger then the change will also be debounced before being
committed.
In most cases this should not have a significant impact on how `NgModelController`
is used: If `updateOn` includes `default` then `$setViewValue` will trigger
a (potentially debounced) commit immediately.
* `$cancelUpdate()` - is renamed to `$rollbackViewValue()` and has the same meaning,
which is to revert the current `$viewValue` back to the `$lastCommittedViewValue`,
to cancel any pending debounced updates and to re-render the input.

To migrate code that used `$cancelUpdate()` follow the example below:

Before:

```
  $scope.resetWithCancel = function (e) {
    if (e.keyCode == 27) {
      $scope.myForm.myInput1.$cancelUpdate();
      $scope.myValue = '';
    }
  };
```

After:

```
  $scope.resetWithCancel = function (e) {
    if (e.keyCode == 27) {
      $scope.myForm.myInput1.$rollbackViewValue();
      $scope.myValue = '';
    }
  }
```

The component that gets passed into renderComponent isn't guaranteed to be the
instance that gets mounted. We want to clone the instance.

Unit tests need to reason about the mounted instance. The first code mod changes:

  ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<identifier>)

into

  <identifier> = ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(<identifier>)

Using this scripts:

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)ReactTestUtils\.renderIntoDocument\(\s*([$a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*\)' \
   '\1\2 = ReactTestUtils.renderIntoDocument(\2)'

In the second case I do the same for React.renderComponent. However, there are
alot more unnecessary matches so I only codemod if the same identifier occurs
later in the file.

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)React.renderComponent\(\s*([$a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*?,(.*?\n?.*?\s\2\b)' \
   '\1\2 = React.renderComponent(\2,\3'

And one more for ReactMount.renderComponent used by internals.

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)ReactMount.renderComponent\(\s*([$a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\s*?,(.*?\n?.*?\s\2\b)' \
   '\1\2 = ReactMount.renderComponent(\2,\3'

This still matches many unnecessary cases where the second occurance of the
identifier is a redeclaration or comment. But this code mod doesn't hurt in
those cases.

Finally I have to do the same for:

  this.<identifier> = React.renderComponent(this.<identifier>,

This is a common pattern for production code but not tests. Some of these call
sites will likely break when we move to true descriptors.

  scripts/bin/codemod -m -d ~/www --extensions js \
   '^(\s*)React.renderComponent\((\s*)this\.([$a-zA-Z0-9\_\.]+)\s*?,' \

This fixes a regression that was introduced in 2bcd02d. Basically, the problem was that render() removed the wrong option from the select controller since it assumed that the option that was removed has the same label as the excessive option in existingOptions, but this is only correct if the option was popped from the end of the array. We now remember for each label whether it was added or removed (or removed at some point and then added at a different point) and report to the select controller only about options that were actually removed or added, ignoring any options that just moved.

All the resolves for a route are now attached to the route's local scope,
as the property whose name is given by the `resolveAs` property on the
route definition.

If `resolveAs` is not specified it defaults to `$resolve`.

This will make it easier to use `ngRoute`, by being able to reference all
the resolve values for the route, directly on the scope, rather than having
to implement a controller just to copy the resolves across manually.

For example, rather than

```js
$routeProvider.when('/', {
  resolve: {
    item1: ($http) => $http.get(...),
    item2: ($http) => $http.get(...)
  },
  template: '<my-app item1=""vm.item1"" item2=""vm.item2"">'</my-app>`,
  controllerAs: 'vm',
  controller: ['item1', 'item2', function(item1, item2) {
    this.item1 = item1;
    this.item2 = item2;
  }]
});
```

one can now do

```js
$routeProvider.when('/', {
  resolve: {
    item1: ($http) => $http.get(...),
    item2: ($http) => $http.get(...)
  },
  template: '<my-app item1=""$resolve.item1"" item2=""$resolve.item2"">'</my-app>`
});
```

BREAKING CHANGE:

A new property is being attached to the scope of the route. The default name
for this property is `$resolve`. If your scope already contains a property
with this name then it will be hidden or overwritten.

In this case, you should choose a custom name for this property, that will
not collide with other properties on the scope, by specifying the `resolveAs`
property on the route.

`checkboxInputType` and `ngList` directives need to have special logic for whether
they are empty or not.  Previously this had been hard coded into their
own directives or the `ngRequired` directive.  This made it difficult to handle
these special cases.

This change factors out the question of whether an input is empty into a method
`$isEmpty` on the `ngModelController`.  The `ngRequired` directive now uses this
method when testing for validity and directives, such as `checkbox` or `ngList`
can override it to apply logic specific to their needs.

We need to be able to build angular at older shas, without the lock file / shrinkwrap file
the dependencies will resolve differently on different machines and at different times.

This will help us avoid broken builds and hard to track down issues.

I had to manually edit this file after it was generated because `npm shrinkwrap` will install
optional dependencies as if they were hard dependencies.

See: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/2679#issuecomment-37361236

My manual edit:

```

Additionally chokidar doesn't list the dependencies above as optional, but that will hopefully
be soon fixed: https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar/pull/106

In the meantime the patch from the PR above needs to be applied to
node_modules/karma/node_modules/chokidar/package.json before running `npm shrinkwrap`

----

After this change is applied, angular core developers don't need to do anything differently,
except when updating dependencies we need to call `npm update && npm shrinkwrap --dev`
followed by reappling my patch above until npm's bug.

If several children complete leaving before rendering TransitionGroup,
only the last one was removed. This could easily happen if
callback in componentWillLeave is called synchronously and several items
are removed from array. The other case is when ReactCSSTransitionGroup
has transitionLeave={false} and array is also cleaned up.

The bug was happening because this.state.children was used as a base for
children removal and it wasn't updated until the render, so only the last
removal was actually happening.

Fix involves keeping the updated children state between invocations of
_handleDoneLeaving. After updating this.state and rendering,
updatedState is cleaned up and ready for subsequent array modifications.

Test case included.

New module! With this, we have a new module that uses the component tree to store DOM nodes. Most of the logic in this file relates to markup adoption -- if we were to drop that (along with server rendering) this file could just be a `return inst._nativeNode;`.

This works with useCreateElement only because we need to reference each node as it's created.

Events is now the only thing using ReactMount.getNode -- I'll introduce pointers back from the DOM nodes (and a `ReactDOMComponentTree.getInstanceFromNode`) and make that work.

The documentation on context is incorrect and misleading:

1. ""Angular expressions must use $window explicitly to refer to the global
   `window` object"": expressions cannot access `$window`
1. The example doesn't actually attempt to use $window in a expression. It's in a
   function called from an expression, which incorrectly implies to readers that:
  1. functions ARE expressions
  1. functions called by expressions can't access `window`

Here's [a plunkr](http://plnkr.co/edit/Gd4xAV?p=preview) to make both these issues clear.

This change fixes the errors and informs the reader about Angular's `$window` etc services,
and adds an explicit example of an expression not being able to access `window`.

Before in RC0 and RC1 $animateCss would not return anything if a
CSS-based animation was not detected. This was a messy API decision
which resulted in the user having to have an if statement to handle the
failure case. This patch ensures that an animator object with the start()
and end() functions is always returned. If an animation is not detected
then the preperatory CSS styles and classes are removed immediately and
the element is cleaned up, however a ""dump"" animator object is still
returned which allows for callbacks and promises to be applied.

The returned object now also contains a `valid` property which can be
examined to determine whether an animation is set to run on the element.

BREAKING CHANGE: The $animateCss service will now always return an
object even if the animation is not set to run. If your code is using
$animateCss then please consider the following code change:

```
// before
var animator = $animateCss(element, { ... });
if (!animator) {
  continueApp();
  return;
}
var runner = animator.start();
runner.done(continueApp);
runner.then(continueApp);

// now
var animator = $animateCss(element, { ... });
var runner = animator.start();
runner.done(continueApp);
runner.then(continueApp);

Place phoneId binding in a proper HTML node

The code where the phoneId binding in the phone-detail.html template is first explained in step 7
of the tutorial doesn't make it a child of a proper HTML node, which makes the end-to-end test
against the view (also introduced in step 7) fail.

The test acquires the binding right from the view (by.binding('phoneId')), and apparently this
operation fails when the binding is not a child of an HTML node, and therefore the entire test also
fails. As soon as the binding is placed inside a <span></span> tag pair, the binding is found and
the test passes. The code on github for step 7 has it right, the binding is within the span tags,
but in the documentation I'm patching here the span's are missing.

Although demo apps run in an isolated environment, we need to be able to tell them to disable
animations when we are running end-to-end tests.  By sharing the same instance of $animate
between the two environments we can disable animation across the board.

The $animate service uses the $$postDigestQueue to run animations.  The outer $animate
service uses the outer $$postDigestQueue and to queue up these animations.  This means that
when we run a digest inside the embedded scope, the animations are never performed - they
just sit in the outer scope's queue and are only run when a digest is run on the outer scope.
By sharing this queue across the two scopes the animations are performed correctly.

With the recent refactoring of $location service we changed this behavior
resulting in a regression.

Previously we thought that html5 mode always required base[href]
to be set in order for urls to resolve properly. It turns out that
base[href] is problematic because it makes anchor urls (#foo) to
always resolve to the base url, which is almost always incorrect
and results in all anchors links and other anchor urls (e.g. svg
references) to be broken.

For this reason, we should now start recommending that people just
deploy to root context (/) and not set the base[href] when using
the html5 mode (push/pop history state).

If it's impossible to deploy to the root context then either all
urls in the app must be absolute or base[href] must be set with the
caveat that anchor urls in such app won't work.

only be in tests, since in production the DOM
would be attached to render tree and removal

This is a bit poorly structured. I'll restructure when the pieces
are better in place.

Basically we reset the priority of a node before work on the
children. The children then bump their parent if they end up
having work left.

This is the first time we're seeing deep updates happening. The
new unit test demonstrates this.

There is an interesting case that happens when we fall back out of
a deep update. We end up ""completing"" a node that we didn't begin.
This probably breaks in coroutines. When that completes, it'll try
to render the sibling next but that should bail out so we check
for any pending work on the sibling. That one I'm not sure about.

- since NaN !== NaN in javascript digest can get into an infinite loop
  when model value is set to NaN
- angular.equals(NaN, NaN) should return true since that's what we
  expect when comparing primitives or objects containing NaN values

Previously NaN because of its special === properties was used as the
initial value for watches, but that results in issues when NaN is used
as model value.

In order to allow for model to be anything incuding undefined and NaN we
need to mark the initial value differently in a way that would avoid
these issues, allow us to run digest without major perf penalties and
allow for clients to determine if the listener is being called because
the watcher is being initialized or because the model changed. This
implementation covers all of these scenarios.

BREAKING CHANGE: previously to detect if the listener was called because
the watcher was being initialized, it was suggested that clients check
if old value is NaN. With this change, the check should be if the newVal
equals the oldVal.

Under specific circumstances, ngMessages would go into an infinite loop and crash the
browser / page:
- At least two ngMessage elements are wrapped inside another element (e.g. ngTransclude)
- The first message is currently visible
- The first message is removed (e.g. when the whole ngMessages element is removed by an ngIf)

When a message is removed, it looks for a previous message - in this specific case it would misidentify
the second message for a previous message, which would then cause the first message to be marked as the
second message's next message, resulting in an infinite loop, and crash.

This fix ensures that when searching for previous messages, ngMessage walks the DOM in a way so
that messages that come after the current message are never identified as previous messages.

This commit also detaches and destroys all child ngMessage elements when the ngMessages element is
destroyed, which should improve performance slightly.

Summary:
After #2570, `mountDepth` is only used to enforce that `setProps` and `replaceProps` is only invoked on the top-level component. This replaces `mountDepth` with a simpler `isTopLevel` boolean set by `ReactMount` which reduces the surface area of the internal API and removes the need to thread `mountDepth` throughout React core.

Previously, the location's internal search object could be set by passing an object to the search()

object, but those changes would not appear in the composed url.

Now, the object is cloned, so the result of location.search() should match the contents of
location.absUrl(), provided the object returned from location.search() is not changed.

In IE10/11, it is apparently possible to have a Selection or Range object that has the following properties:

  - `anchorNode` === `focusNode` (Selection) or `startContainer` === `endContainer` (Range)
  - `anchorOffset` === `focusOffset` (Selection) or `startOffset` === `endOffset` (Range)
  - `isCollapsed` === `false` (Selection) or `collapsed` === `false` (Range)

As defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range/ranges.html, this doesn't really make sense. Since the nodes and offsets are the same, the ""collapsed"" value should be `true`.

Moreover, when calling `selection.toString()` in this case, it appears that the entire text contents of `body` -- including `<script>` tag contents -- are considered within the selection. I thought maybe the selected nodes were missing from the DOM or something, but no, they're there.

Sidestep all of this in `ReactDOMSelection` by calculating the `collapsed` property manually and setting the selection length directly to zero if it is actually collapsed.

Side note: I think that for selection restoration on contenteditables, we shouldn't try to do this offset calculation. We should just use the structure provided natively (nodes and offsets) since we can restore using that structure as well.

new methods simplify writing assertions that verify that child scopes were properly
destroyed or that watchers were deregistered.

In 1.2, the behavior of ngInclude was modified to use DOM APIs rather than jqLite. This means that
even when jQuery was loaded, ngInclude was not calling into it, and thus scripts were not eval'd
as they had been before. Although the use of ngInclude to eval scripts as a lazy-loading strategy
was never an intentional feature, this patch restores the ability to do so.

When using the [timeout attribute](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-timeout-attribute) and an XHR
request times out, browsers trigger the `timeout` event (and execute the XHR's `ontimeout`
callback). Additionally, Safari 9 handles timed-out requests in the same way, even if no `timeout`
has been explicitly set on the XHR.
In the above cases, `$httpBackend` would fail to capture the XHR's completing (with an error), so
the corresponding `$http` promise would never get fulfilled.

Note that using `$http`'s `timeout` configuration option does **not** rely on the XHR's `timeout`
property (or its `ontimeout` callback).

To convert non-constant strings into constant expressions, simply wrap them in an extra pair of quotes, like so:

This splits the Fiber type into Fiber and Instance. This could be
two different object instances to save memory. However, to avoid
GC thrash I merge them into one.

When ReactChildFiber reconciles children, it clones the previous
fiber. This creates a new tree for work-in-progress. The idea is
that once flushed, this new tree will be used at the root.

However, we know that we'll never need more than two trees
at a time. Therefore my clone function stores the clone on the
original. Effectively this creates a fiber pool.

Ideally, the .alternate field shouldn't be used outside of clone
so that everything can work with pure immutability. I cheat a bit
for now so I don't have to pass both trees everywhere.

ReactChildFiber is a bit hacky for reuse and doesn't solve all
cases. Will fix that once I try to get parity.

Relax the argument type checks. Currently we throw for non-objects and terminals
but Object.assign does a coercion to Object instead. It also allows merging
Arrays as if they are objects.

This also relaxes the check for dependents such as ImmutableObject. This sucks
but it will allow us to use a fast code path to native Object.assign.

We always have the option of adding warnings to Object.assign or static type
checks.

I'm keeping the null check. Object.assign throws for null checks.

We'll also start returning the result of coercions just like Object.assign.

The location service, and other portions of the application,
were relying on a complicated regular expression to get parts of a URL.
But there is already a private urlUtils provider,
which relies on HTMLAnchorElement to provide this information,
and is suitable for most cases.

In order to make urlUtils more accessible in the absence of DI,
its methods were converted to standalone functions available globally.

The urlUtils.resolve method was renamed urlResolve,
and was refactored to only take 1 argument, url,
and not the 2nd ""parse"" boolean.
The method now always returns a parsed url.
All places in code which previously wanted a string instead of a parsed
url can now get the value from the href property of the returned object.

Tests were also added to ensure IPv6 addresses were handled correctly.

BREAKING CHANGE:
This commit introduces the notion of ""private"" properties (properties
whose names begin and/or end with an underscore) on the scope chain.
These properties will not be available to Angular expressions (i.e. {{
}} interpolation in templates and strings passed to `$parse`)  They are
freely available to JavaScript code (as before).

Motivation
----------
Angular expressions execute in a limited context.  They do not have
direct access to the global scope, Window, Document or the Function
constructor.  However, they have direct access to names/properties on
the scope chain.  It has been a long standing best practice to keep
sensitive APIs outside of the scope chain (in a closure or your
controller.)  That's easier said that done for two reasons: (1)
JavaScript does not have a notion of private properties so if you need
someone on the scope chain for JavaScript use, you also expose it to
Angular expressions, and (2) the new ""controller as"" syntax that's now
in increased usage exposes the entire controller on the scope chain
greatly increaing the exposed surface.  Though Angular expressions are
written and controlled by the developer, they (1) typically deal with
user input and (2) don't get the kind of test coverage that JavaScript
code would.  This commit provides a way, via a naming convention, to
allow publishing/restricting properties from controllers/scopes to
Angular expressions enabling one to only expose those properties that
are actually needed by the expressions.

`npm install` blindly accepts the node_modules cache and doesn't verify if it matches requirements in the current npm-shrinkwrap.json.

This means that if we are using travis cache and npm-shrinkwrap.json changes npm will keep on using the old dependencies, in spite of the guarantees that shrinkwrap claims to offer.

https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/11110#issuecomment-75302946

With this change, we will blow away the node_modules directory if the shrinkwrap changes compared to the one

When a event is finished propagating through Scope hierarchy the event's `currentScope` property
should be reset to `null` to avoid accidental use of this property in asynchronous event handlers.

In the previous code, the event's property would contain a reference to the last Scope instance that
was visited during the traversal, which is unlikely what the code trying to grab scope reference expects.

BREAKING CHANGE: $broadcast and $emit will now reset the `currentScope` property of the event to
null once the event finished propagating. If any code depends on asynchronously accessing thei
`currentScope` property, it should be migrated to use `targetScope` instead. All of these cases
should be considered programming bugs.

- route fires after/before route change even if there is no route (when no otherwise specified)

Solution:

- route has no idea about scope, whole scope business moved to ng:view (creating/destroying)
- scope is created (and controller instantiated) AFTER compiling the content
- that means on $afterRouteChange - there is no scope yet (current.scope === undefined)
- added $contentLoaded event fired by ng:view, after linking the content

It is now possible to ask the $compiler's isolate scope property machinery to bind isolate
scope properties to a controller rather than scope itself. This feature requires the use of
controllerAs, so that the controller-bound properties may still be referenced from binding
expressions in views.

The current syntax is to prefix the scope name with a '@', like so:

    scope: {
        ""myData"": ""=someData"",
        ""myString"": ""@someInterpolation"",
        ""myExpr"": ""&someExpr""
    },
    controllerAs: ""someCtrl"",
    bindtoController: true

The putting of properties within the context of the controller will only occur if
controllerAs is used for an isolate scope with the `bindToController` property of the
directive definition object set to `true`.

This feature allows disabling Angular's requirement of using a <base/> tag
when using location in html5Mode, for applications that do not require
using $location in html5Mode in IE9. To accomplish this, the $locationProvider.html5Mode 
method has been changed to accept a definition object which can optionally set a 
requireBase property to false, removing the requirement of a <base> tag being present
when html5Mode is enabled.

BREAKING CHANGE: The $location.html5Mode API has changed to allow enabling html5Mode by
    passing an object (as well as still supporting passing a boolean). Symmetrically, the
    method now returns an object instead of a boolean value.

    To migrate, follow the code example below:

    Before:

    var mode = $locationProvider.html5Mode();

    After:

    var mode = $locationProvider.html5Mode().enabled;

`ng(Pattern|Minlength|Maxlength)` directives will now validate the
`ngModel` when on an element that is not an `input` or
a `textarea`. Previously, only their HTML5 counterparts worked on
every element.

This is because the three validators were extracted
into  separate directives (see 26d91b653ac224d9d4166fea855346f5e4c4a7b4
and 1be9bb9d3527e0758350c4f7417a4228d8571440), whereas the aliased
attribute handling assumes the validators will only exist on
`input|textarea` (see d9b90d7c10a8e1bacbee0aeb7e86093cca9e8ed2 and
25541c1f876a16c892d71faae11727bec7bba98c).

Since `ngMin` and `ngMax` are also aliased attributes, this means
observers of `min` and `max` will be fired if `ngMin` and `ngMax`
change. This will happen on any element, even if it does not have
an `ngModel`. However, since min/max validators are only ever added
as part of the `input[number|textarea]` types, even if the element
has an `ngModel`, no validators will be added.

Finally the commit also tests that `ng-required` works on any element,
although that validator worked on all elements before this fix.

Using a deep watch caused Angular to enter an infinite recursion in the
case that the model contains a circular reference.  Using `$watchCollection`
instead prevents this from happening.

This change means that we will not re-render the directive when there is
a change below the first level of properties on the model object. Making
such a change is a strange corner case that is unlikely to occur in practice
and the directive is not designed to support such a situation. The
documentation has been updated to clarify this behaviour.

This is not a breaking change since in 1.3.x this scenario did not work
at all. Compare 1.3.15: http://plnkr.co/edit/zsgnhflQ3M1ClUSrsne0?p=preview

* PropTypes: distinguish nullable from optional object field

This gives a more precise message (no type semantics change) to the case of passing a field in an object, but whose value is `null`:

Before:

```js
propTypes: {
  foo: React.PropTypes.number.isRequired
}
```

Would scream ""Required prop `foo` was not specified in `MyComp`"".

Now it'll be ""Required prop `foo` was specified in `MyComp`, but its value is `null`."".

Works as expected in nested objects.

This fixes the issue of a component transitively passing a `null`, specifying the correct field to the child but have the child tell it that it didn't provide the prop.

Optional field and nullable are two different things anyway.

* Add missing test case.

* Reword messages.

When using $resource you must setup your actions carefully based on what the server returns.
If the server responds to a request with an array then you must configure the action with
`isArray:true` and vice versa.  The built-in `get` action defaults to `isArray:false` and the
`query` action defaults to `isArray:true`, which is must be changed if the server does not do this.
Before the error message was an exception inside angular.copy, which didn't explain what the
real problem was. Rather than changing the way that angular.copy works, this change ensures that
a better error message is provided to the programmer if they do not set up their resource actions
correctly.

is not a function.

User-controlled imports or stylesheets can run script in your origin,
which warrants that we require that they are safe `RESOURCE_URL`s.

Closes #14687

BREAKING CHANGE

`link[href]` attributes are now protected via `$sce`, which prevents interpolated
values that fail the `RESOURCE_URL` context tests from being used in interpolation.

For example if the application is running at `https://docs.angularjs.org` then the
following will fail:

```
<link href=""{{ 'http://mydomain.org/unsafe.css' }}"" rel=""stylesheet"">
```

By default, `RESOURCE_URL` safe URLs are only allowed from the same domain and protocol
as the application document.

To use URLs from other domains and/or protocols, you may either whitelist them or
wrap it into a trusted value by calling `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl(url)`.

This avoids using .alternate as much as possible and isolates it
to the root. For anything that is ""work in progress"" this happens
to be the same as the alternate field. To avoid an extra ""current""
field on work in progress fibers, we can just use the alternate.

The timing for when this is true might be a bit tricky to reason
about so I explicitly pass the current value everywhere from the
top. That way we can always change this in the future to use an
explicit field or we can try to maintain a parallel data
structure that remembers which was the ""current"" fiber for each
wip child.

I still think the semantics of flattening children is valid but we'll
want to revert the flattening implementation while we solidify the
semantics and try another approach.

This reverts flattening so that this.props.children can once again be
either a single child, flat array or nested array.

mapChildren calls flattenChildren before doing anything else. This is
not the most efficient approach but I wanted to keep this inital diff
simple. It also ignores empty values for backwards compatibility.

We may want to try another approach where empty values are included
in the map.

Validation of keys is still done inside ReactComponent. Ideally I'd
like to extract that into a separate module but to avoid cyclic
dependencies, I'm keeping it in ReactComponent for now.

This fix changes anchored animations in ngAnimate to not append a series
of CSS classes with a `-suffix` prefix to the anchor element. Use
the `ng-anchor` instead CSS class instead.

BREAKING CHANGE: Prior to this fix there were to ways to apply CSS
animation code to an anchor animation. With this fix, the suffixed
CSS -anchor classes are now not used anymore for CSS anchor animations.

Instead just use the `ng-anchor` CSS class like so:

```html
<div class=""container-animation"" ng-if=""on"">
   <div ng-animate-ref=""1"" class=""my-anchor-element""></div>
</div>

<div class=""container-animation"" ng-if=""!on"">
   <div ng-animate-ref=""1"" class=""my-anchor-element""></div>
</div>
```

**before**:
```css
/* before (notice the container-animation CSS class) */
.container-animation-anchor {
  transition:0.5s linear all;
}
```

**now**:
```css
/* now (just use `ng-anchor` on a class that both the
   elements that contain `ng-animate-ref` share) */
.my-anchor-element.ng-anchor {
  transition:0.5s linear all;
}

It is now possible to ask the $compiler's isolate scope property machinery to bind isolate
scope properties to a controller rather than scope itself. This feature requires the use of
controllerAs, so that the controller-bound properties may still be referenced from binding
expressions in views.

The current syntax is to prefix the scope name with a '@', like so:

    scope: {
        ""myData"": ""=someData"",
        ""myString"": ""@someInterpolation"",
        ""myExpr"": ""&someExpr""
    },
    controllerAs: ""someCtrl"",
    bindtoController: true

The putting of properties within the context of the controller will only occur if
controllerAs is used for an isolate scope with the `bindToController` property of the
directive definition object set to `true`.

This changes the way option elements are generated when the ngOption collection changes.
Previously, we would re-use option elements when possible (updating their text and
label). Now, we first remove all currently displayed options and the create new options for the
collection. The new options are first appended to a documentFragment, which is in the end appended
to the selectElement.

Using documentFragment improves render performance in IE with large option collections
(> 100 elements) considerably.

Creating new options from scratch fixes issues in IE where the select would become unresponsive
to user input.

Input elements use the value attribute as their default value if the value property is not set.
Once the value property has been set (by adding input), it will not react to changes to
the value attribute anymore. Setting both attribute and property fixes this behavior, and
makes it possible to use ngValue as a one-way bind.

Closes #14031
Closes #13984

POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE:

`ngValue` now also sets the value *property* of its element. Previously, it would only set the
value *attribute*. This allows `ngValue` to be used as a one-way binding mechanism on `input[text]`
and `textarea` elements without `ngModel`. Previously, these input types would not update correctly
when only the value attribute was changed.
This change should not affect any applications, as `ngValue` is mainly used on `input[radio]` and
`option` elements, both of which are unaffected by this change.

Previously, `ngAria` would provide keyboard support for non-native buttons (via `ngClick`), by
binding the `ngClick` handler to the `keypress` event. In an attempt to better emulate the behavior
of native buttons, `ngAria` will now bind to the `keydown` event (instead of `keypress`).

The configuration flag for this feature has been renamed from `bindKeypress` to `bindKeydown`, to
closer describe the underlying behavior.

Fixes #14063
Closes #14065

BREAKING CHANGE:

If you were explicitly setting the value of the `bindKeypress` flag, you need to change your code to
use `bindKeydown` instead.

Before: `$ariaProvider.config({bindKeypress: xyz})`
After: `$ariaProvider.config({bindKeydown: xyz})`

**Note:**
If the element already has any of the `ngKeydown`/`ngKeyup`/`ngKeypress` directives, `ngAria` will
_not_ bind to the `keydown` event, since it assumes that the developer has already taken care of
keyboard interaction for that element.

Although it is not expected to affect many applications, it might be desirable to keep the previous
behavior of binding to the `keypress` event instead of the `keydown`. In that case, you need to
manually use the `ngKeypress` directive (in addition to `ngClick`).

Before:

```html
<div ng-click=""onClick()"">
  I respond to `click` and `keypress` (not `keydown`)
</div>
```

After:

```html
<div ng-click=""onClick()"" ng-keypress=""onClick()"">
  I respond to `click` and `keypress` (not `keydown`)
</div>
<!-- OR -->
<div ng-click=""onClick()"">
  I respond to `click` and `keydown` (not `keypress`)
</div>
```

Finally, it is possible that this change affects your unit or end-to-end tests. If you are currently
expecting your custom buttons to automatically respond to the `keypress` event (due to `ngAria`),
you need to change the tests to trigger `keydown` events instead.

Issue: multi-elements ng-repeat (ng-repeat-start, ng-repeat-end) can contain elements with a trancluding directive. This directive changes content of the row (template) and ng-repeat does not work correctly (when removing/moving rows), because ng-repeat works with the original template (elements).

This changes ng-repeat behavior to traverse the DOM to find current elements everytime we are moving/removing rows (if the template has multiple elements).

See #2869

Checks that the *second* argument of warning and invariant are a literal

arguments is correct based on the number of %s substrings.

This commit also fixes a few places where the existing code had broken
error messages!

The rule itself is pretty straightforward, although adding the tests
ended up being a bit painful, as eslint-tester depends on mocha, and
therefore needs to be run in a separate grunt task.

BREAKING CHANGE: Both the `$animate:before` and `$animate:after` DOM events must be now
registered prior to the $animate operation taking place. The `$animate:close` event
can be registered anytime afterwards.

DOM callbacks used to fired for each and every animation operation that occurs within the
$animate service provided in the ngAnimate module. This may end up slowing down an
application if 100s of elements are being inserted into the page. Therefore after this
change callbacks are only fired if registered on the element being animated.

I'm not entirely sold on the idea of shipping minErr with the loade. With the current state, the angular-loader behavior is completely broken - this is just a quick fix, we can revisit this change in the future.

`for in` is much faster than `Object.keys()` but `for in` includes properties from the prototype.

http://jsperf.com/for-in-vs-object-keys2

All the uses of shallowCopy don't deal with objects with heavy prototypes, except for Attributes instances
in $compile.

For this reason it's better to special-case Attributes constructor and make it do it's own shallow copy.
This cleans up the Attribute/$compile code as well.

In apps that create lots of scopes (apps with large tables) the uid generation
shows up in the profiler and adds a few milliseconds. Using simple counter
doesn't have this overhead.

I think the initial fear of overflowing and thus using string alphanum sequence
is unjustified because even if an app was to create lots of scopes non-stop,
you could create about 28.6 million scopes per seconds for 10 years before
you would reach a number that can't be accurately represented in JS

BREAKING CHANGE: Scope#$id is now of time number rather than string. Since the
id is primarily being used for debugging purposes this change should not affect
anyone.

The fallback is also useful for emitting `beforeInput` events, so it
makes sense to simply combine these plugins.

This change also incorporates a recent change to the Google Input Tools

on the custom composition events it emits.

When the min/max attributes are empty (i.e. `attrs.min/max === ''`), there
should be no min/max validation applied (i.e. all values should be valid
wrt min/max). This works correctly for `input[number]`, but not for date
input family (`input[date/datetime-local/time/week/month]`).

In the case on `input[number]`, an empty string for `attrs.min/max` is
translated to `undefined` for `minVal/maxVal` and a check for
`isUndefined(minVal/maxVal)` ensures that no min/max validation takes
place.
For the data input family, an empty string for `attrs.min/max` is
translated to `NaN` (by `parseDate()`), so an additional check (for
`isNaN(minVal/maxVal)`) is required.

Prior to this fix there was another patch that threw an exception if the
provided options value was not of an object type. While this is correct
in terms of logic, it caused issues with plugins and tools that are
designed to work with multiple version of Angular. This fix ensures that
these plugins work since an invalid options value is ignored by
`$animate`.

During its linking phase, `ngView` relies on the info provided in `$route.current` for
instantiating the initial view. `$route.current` is set in the callback of a listener to
`$locationChangeSuccess`, which is registered during the instantiation of the `$route` service.

Thus, it is crucial that the `$route` service is instantiated _before_ the initial
`$locationChangeSuccess` event is fired. Since `ngView` declares `$route` as a dependency, the
service is instantiated in time, if `ngView` is present during the initial load of the page.

Yet, in cases where `ngView` is included in a template that is loaded asynchronously (e.g. in
another directive's template), the directive factory might not be called soon enough for `$route`
to be instantiated before the initial `$locationChangeSuccess` event is fired.

This commit fixes it, by enabling eager instantiation of `$route` (during the initialization phase).
Eager instantiation can be disabled (restoring the old behavior), but is on by default.

Fixes #1213
Closes #14893

BREAKING CHANGE:

In cases where `ngView` was loaded asynchronously, `$route` (and its dependencies; e.g. `$location`)
might also have been instantiated asynchronously. After this change, `$route` (and its dependencies)
will - by default - be instantiated early on.

Although this is not expected to have unwanted side-effects in normal application bebavior, it may
affect your unit tests: When testing a module that (directly or indirectly) depends on `ngRoute`, a
request will be made for the default route's template. If not properly ""trained"", `$httpBackend`
will complain about this unexpected request.

You can restore the previous behavior (and avoid unexpected requests in tests), by using
`$routeProvider.eagerInstantiationEnabled(false)`.

With ngAnimate, CSS transitions, that are not properlty triggered, are forceably closed off
by appling a fallback property. The fallback property approach works, however, its styling
itself may effect CSS inheritance or cause the element to render improperly. Therefore, its
best to stick to using a scheduled timeout to run sometime after the highest animation time
has passed.

For transcluded directives, the transclude function can be lazily compiled
most of the time since the contents will not be needed until the
`transclude` function was actually invoked.  For example, the `transclude`
function that is passed to `ng-if` or `ng-switch-when` does not need to be
invoked until the condition that it's bound to has been matched.  For
complex trees or switch statements, this can represent significant
performance gains since compilation of branches is deferred, and that
compilation may never actually happen if it isn't needed.

There are two instances where compilation will not be lazy; when we scan
ahead in the array of directives to be processed and find at least two of
the following:

* A directive that is transcluded and does not allow multiple transclusion
* A directive that has templateUrl and replace: true
* A directive that has a template and replace: true

In both of those cases, we will need to continue eager compilation in
order to generate the multiple transclusion exception at the correct time.

* Resolve refs in the order of the children

React makes no guarantees about ref resolution order. Unfortunately, some of the internal Facebook component APIs (specifically, layer dialogs) currently depend on the ref resolution order. Specifically, the assumption is that if the layer dialog is placed as a last child, by the time it mounts or updates, the refs to any previously declared elements have been resolved.

With the current `ReactMultiChild`, this is *usually* the case but not always. Both initial mount and an update of all components satisfy this assumption: by the time a child mounts or updates, the previous children’s refs have been resolved. The one scenario where it isn’t true is when **a new child is mounted during an update**.

In this case, the `mountComponent()` call used to be delayed until `ReactMultiChild` processes the queue. However, this is inconsistent with how updates normally work: unlike mounting, updating and unmounting happens inside `ReactChildReconciler.updateChildren()` loop.

This PR changes the `mountComponent()` to be performed inside `ReactChildReconciler`, just like `receiveComponent()` and `unmountComponent()`, and thus ensures that `attachRef()` calls are enqueued in the order the children were processed, so by the time the next child flushes, the refs of the previous children have been resolved.

This is not ideal and will probably be broken by incremental reconciler in the future. However, since we are trying to get rid of mixins in the internal codebase, and layered components are one of the biggest blockers to that, it’s lesser evil to temporarily make ref resolution order more strict until we have time to fix up the layer APIs to not rely on it, and are able to relax it again (which would be a breaking change).

This fix ensures that a structural child animation will never close a
parent class based early so that the CSS classes for the child are ready
for it to perform its CSS animation. The reasoning for the past for this
was because their is a one frame delay before the classes were applied.
If a parent and a child animation happen at the same time then the
animations may not be picked up for the element since the CSS classes
may not have been applied yet.

This fix ensures that parent CSS classes are applied in a synchronous
manner without the need to run a one RAF wait. The solution to this was
to apply the preparation classes during the pre-digest phase and then
apply the CSS classes right after with a forced reflow paint.

BREAKING CHANGE: CSS classes added/removed by ngAnimate are now applied
synchronously once the first digest has passed.

The previous behavior involved ngAnimate having to wait for one
requestAnimationFrame before CSS classes were added/removed. The CSS classes
are now applied directly after the first digest that is triggered after
`$animate.addClass`, `$animate.removeClass` or `$animate.setClass` is
called. If any of your code relies on waiting for one frame before
checking for CSS classes on the element then please change this
behavior. If a parent class-based animation, however, is run through a
JavaScript animation which triggers an animation for `beforeAddClass`
and/or `beforeRemoveClass` then the CSS classes will not be applied
in time for the children (and the parent class-based animation will not
be cancelled by any child animations).

Polish the Scenario Runner UI to include:
- a scroll pane that steps appear in since the list can be very long
- Collapse successful tests
- Show the line where the DSL statements were when there's an error (Chrome, Firefox)

Also:
- Remove lots angular.bind calls to reduce the amount of stack space used.
- Use setTimeout(...,0) to schedule the next future to let the browser breathe and have it repaint the steps. Also prevents overflowing the stack when an it() creates many futures.
- Run afterEach() handlers even if the it() block fails.
- Make navigateTo() take a function as the second argument so you can compute a URL in the future.
- Add wait() DSL statement to allow interactive debugging of tests.
- Allow custom jQuery selectors with element(...).query(fn) DSL statement.

Known Issues:
- All afterEach() handlers run even if a beforeEach() handler fails. Only after handlers for the same level as the failure and above should run.

It was possible to use `{}.__defineGetter__.call(null, 'alert', (0).valueOf.bind(0))` to set

to arbitrary code execution in browsers that let you obtain the window object using Array methods.
Prevent that by blacklisting the nasty __{define,lookup}{Getter,Setter}__ properties.

BREAKING CHANGE:
This prevents the use of __{define,lookup}{Getter,Setter}__ inside angular
expressions. If you really need them for some reason, please wrap/bind them to make them
less dangerous, then make them available through the scope object.

This modifies the injector to prevent automatic annotation from occurring for a given injector.

This behaviour can be enabled when bootstrapping the application by using the attribute
""ng-strict-di"" on the root element (the element containing ""ng-app""), or alternatively by passing
an object with the property ""strictDi"" set to ""true"" in angular.bootstrap, when bootstrapping
manually.

JS example:

    angular.module(""name"", [""dependencies"", ""otherdeps""])
      .provider(""$willBreak"", function() {
        this.$get = function($rootScope) {
        };
      })
      .run([""$willBreak"", function($willBreak) {
        // This block will never run because the noMagic flag was set to true,
        // and the $willBreak '$get' function does not have an explicit
        // annotation.
      }]);

    angular.bootstrap(document, [""name""], {
      strictDi: true
    });

HTML:

    <html ng-app=""name"" ng-strict-di>
      <!-- ... -->
    </html>

This will only affect functions with an arity greater than 0, and without an $inject property.

Previously, $validate would execute the parsers to obtain a
modelValue for validation. This was necessary, because a validator
that is called outside of model / view update (e.g. from an observer)
otherwise might only an undefined modelValue, because a previous
view update has found a validation $error and set the model
to undefined (as is tradition in angular)

This is problematic as validators that are run immediately after
the ngModelController initializes would parse the modelValue
and replace the model, even though there had been no user input.

The solution is to go back to an older design: the ngModelController
will now internally record the $$rawModelValue. This means a model
or view update will store the set / parsed modelValue regardless
of validity, that is, it will never set it to undefined because of
validation errors.

When $validate is called, the $$rawModelValue will passed to the
validators. If the validity has changed, the usual behavior is kept:
if it became invalid, set the model to undefined, if valid,
restore the last available modelValue - the $$rawModelValue.

Additionally, $validate will only update the model when the validity
changed. This is to prevent setting initially invalid models other
than undefined to undefined (see #9063)

4f6f2bce4ac93b85320e42e5023c09d099779b7d,angular/angular.js,1468832969,60,2016-07-18 09:09:29 UTC,"fix($http): properly increment/decrement `$browser.outstandingRequestCount`

Calling `$http` will not increment `$browser.outstandingRequestCount` until after all (potentially)
asynchronous request interceptors have been processed and will decrement it before any (potentially)
asynchronous response interceptors have been processed.
This can lead to `$browser.notifyWhenNoOutstandingRequests` firing
prematurely, which can be problematic in end-to-end tests.

This commit fixes this, by synchronizing the increment/decrement
operations with `$http`'s internal interceptor promise chain.

Fixes #13782
Closes #13862
Closes #14921

BREAKING CHANGE:

HTTP requests now update the outstanding request count synchronously.
Previously the request count would not have been updated until the
request to the server is actually in flight. Now the request count is
updated before the async interceptor is called.

The new behaviour is correct but it may change the expected behaviour in
a small number of e2e test cases where an async request interceptor is
being used.

This diff introduces `TextInputEventPlugin` and `SyntheticTextInputEvent`, which are based on Webkit's native `textInput` event.

In Chrome, Safari, and Opera, the `textInput` event fires prior to the insertion of character data into the document. For normal typing, for example, thevent sequence is: `keydown`, `keypress`, `textInput`, `input`, `keyup`. The `textInput` event contains a `data` field corresponding to the character data that will actually be inserted.

There is also a `beforeinput` event described by http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-type-beforeinput, and this is essentially that event, so it may make sense to rename the plugin.

This event is especially useful because it solves a number of issues we can't currently handle with only keypress and composition events:

  - **Windows Chrome: Trailing characters discarded in Korean IME.** For instance, `안녕하세요` becomes `안녕하세` with the final character discarded by the final `compositionend` event. The `textInput` event fires correctly with the final character.
  - **Windows Chrome: Special characters discarded in IME.** Certain ideographs are discarded in IME mode. In Japanese, typing the ideographic space character is not represented by keypress but //is// represented by the subsequent `textInput`. This issue also applies to punctuation characters in Chinese.
  - **OSX Chrome: Characters from palette discarded.** Inserting characters from the OSX character palette fails, since no keypress is fired.

The plugin is useful for Firefox and IE. For these, we record inserted characters via keypress and compositionend events and dispatch the synthetic event with these characters as the `data` field to match the native `textInput` event.

  - Firefox has no corresponding `textInput` event and has not yet implemented `beforeinput`.
  - IE has a native `textinput` event, but it fires after the DOM mutation has already occurred, so it isn't very useful as an analog to the Webkit version. I'm just not going to bother with it.

Previously, the `$render` function was re-defined in the `select` directive's
`preLink` function. When a `select` element is compiled, every `option`
element inside it is linked and registered with the `selectCtrl`, which
calls `$render` to update the selected `option`. `$render` calls `selectCtrl.writeValue`,
which adds an unknown `option` in case no option is selected. In cases where
`optgroup` elements are followed by a line-break, adding the unknown `option`
confuses the html compiler and makes it call the link function of the following
`option` with a wrong element, which means this option is not correctly
registered.
Since manipulation of the DOM in the `preLink` function is wrong API usage,
the problem cannot be fixed in the compiler.

With this commit, the `$render` function is not re-defined until the `select` directive's
`postLink` function, at which point all `option` elements have been linked
already.

The commit also changes the `toEqualSelectWithOptions` matcher to
take selected options in groups into account.

be blocked. This is to prevent the animation from occuring early on before

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, the order of items when using ngRepeat to iterate
over object properties was guaranteed to be consistent by sorting the
keys into alphabetic order.

Now, the order of the items is browser dependent based on the order returned
from iterating over the object using the `for key in obj` syntax.

It seems that browsers generally follow the strategy of providing
keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions
when keys are deleted and reinstated. See
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#Cross-browser_issues

The best approach is to convert Objects into Arrays by a filter such as
https://github.com/petebacondarwin/angular-toArrayFilter
or some other mechanism, and then sort them manually in the order you need.

The default value of for transclude in component helper is now `false`.

transclusion such as `ng-switch-when` and `ng-repeat`.

BREAKING CHANGE:
Angular 1.5.0.beta.2 introduced the `module.component` helper where `transclude` was true by default.
This changes the default for `transclude` to `false`. If you created components that expected
transclusion then you must change your code to specify `transclude: true`.

This fixes a reconciliation bug introduced by adffa9b0f4128ca4832ddd03fdeca2c9fe434689.

The new unit test case exhibits the bug. When a component that has rendered child components is updated to render inline text, we usually:

 # Unmount and remove all child components.
 # Set the new inline text content.

However, with batched child operations, we do not **remove all child components** until later. The current implementation will set the inline text content and blow away those nodes, causing a fatal when `ReactMultiChild` later tries to find and remove those nodes.

This fixes the bug by ensuring that text content changes are also enqueued.

ddb8081 and 4ea57e7 removed the calls which trimmed leading and trailing whitespace from templates
in the HTML compiler. This broke old versions of jQuery (such as 1.9.1), which do not trim
whitespace in their constructors. Naturally, this would not appear in the jQuery tests, as we are
testing against a version which does trim whitespace in the constructor.

This fix re-adds calls to `trim()` when compiling templates in $compile, in order to avoid breaking
old versions of jQuery.

We run unit tests in “strict” mode and thus can’t monkey-patch `window.location` nor `window.location.reload`. In order to avoid full page reload, we could pass location as argument, or another level of indirection, something like this:
```js
var ourGlobalFunkyLocation = window.location;
function reloadWithDebugInfo() {
  window.name = 'NG_ENABLE_DEBUG_INFO!' + window.name;
  ourGlobalFunkyLocation.reload();
}

// in the test
ourGlobalFunkyLocation = {
  reload: function() {}
};
reloadWithDebugInfo();
ourGlobalFunkyLocation = window.location;
```

I don’t think any of these make sense, just so that we can test setting `window.name`. If the `reloadWithDebugInfo` function was more complicated, I would do it.

I don’t think it’s worthy to confuse production code with extra logic which purpose was only to make testing possible.

Summary:
This makes a few changes to React Core, most notably `ReactEventEmitter` and `ReactEventTopLevelCallback`.

 - Changed `ReactEventEmitter` to use `EventListener` (instead of `NormalizedEventListener`).
 - Deleted `NormalizedEventListener` (which was previously broken).
 - Created `getEventTarget` which is used to get a normalized `target` from a native event.
 - Changed `ReactEventTopLevelCallback` to use `getEventTarget`.
 - Renamed `abstractEventType` to `reactEventType` in `AbstractEvent`.
 - Reanmed `abstractTargetID` to `reactTargetID` in `AbstractEvent`.
 - Removed `originatingTopLevelEventType` from `AbstractEvent` (unused and violates encapsulation).
 - Removed `nativeEvent.target === window` check when refreshing authoritative scroll values (unnecessary).

This actually fixes React because `NormalizedEventListener` does not currently do what it promises to do (which is normalizing `target` on the native event). The `target` event is read-only on native events.

This also revises documentation and adds `@typechecks` to a few modules.

NOTE: Most importantly, this sets the stage for replacing `AbstractEvent` with `ReactEvent` and subclasses, piecemeal.

This is the first step towards descriptors. This will start cloning the
component when it's mounted instead of mounting the first instance.

This avoids an issue where a reference to the first instance can hang around
in props. Since a mounted component gets mutated, the descriptor changes.

We don't need to clone the props object itself. Mutating the shallow props
object of a child that's passed into you is already flawed. Those cases need to
use cloneWithProps. A props object is considered shallow frozen after it leaves
the render it was created in.

won't complain if the parent property is not defined. In order to mantain

of '='. The local property will be undefined is these cases.

IE8 doesn't support oninput and IE9 supports it badly but we can do
almost a perfect shim by listening to a handful of different events
(focus, blur, propertychange, selectionchange, keyup, keydown).

This always triggers event handlers during the browser's event loop (not
later in a setTimeout) and after the value property has been updated.

The only case I know of where this doesn't fire the event immediately is
if (in IE8) you modify the input value using JS and then the user does a
key repeat, in which case we fire the event on the second keydown.

Test Plan:
Modify ballmer-peak example to add es5-shim and to use onTextChange
instead of onInput. In IE8, IE9, and latest Chrome, make sure that the
event is fired upon:

* typing normally,
* backspacing,
* forward-deleting,
* cutting,
* pasting,
* context-menu deleting,
* dragging text to reorder characters.

After modifying the example to change .value, make sure that the event
is not fired as a result of the changes from JS (even when the input box
is focused).

references to `trackexpr` to `track by` since `trackexpr` is not defined
except in the examples.

Added filter + track by example for ngOptions

The documentation for ngRepeat includes such an example specifying the proper
order for filters and and ""track by"" clauses in the comprehension expression,
but these docs for ngOptions do not.

In the Chrome issue (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=381459)
I noticed that the bug can't be reproduced in Chrome 45 and the issue was
closed subsequently. I've also tested again with Chrome 51 and it still works.

Additionally, the Chrome hack was kept in the select code, but wasn't ported to
the ngOptions code when the two split in 7fda214c4f65a6a06b25cf5d5aff013a364e9cef,
and no regression happened.

Nevertheless, a test has been added to guard against a future regression.

Since ngAnimate uses the `ng-animate` CSS class internally to track

accidentally adding / removing the CSS class when an animation is
started and closed.

BREAKING CHANGE: partially or fully using a regex value containing
`ng-animate` as a token is not allowed anymore. Doing so will trigger a
minErr exception to be thrown.

So don't do this:

```js
// only animate elements that contain the `ng-animate` CSS class

// or partially contain it
$animateProvider.classNameFilter(/some-class ng-animate another-class/);

This fix ensures that stagger delays are handled by the $timeout service.

If any stagger code consisted of having BOTH transition staggers and delay staggers

the highest stagger delay value and set the timeout to wait for that before
applying the active CSS class.

In `ngRepeat` if the object to be iterated over is ""array-like"" then it only iterates

methods from being included in the rendered collection.

This commit changes `ngOptions` to iterate in the same way.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Although it is unlikely that anyone is using it in this way, this change does change the
behaviour of `ngOptions` in the following case:

* you are iterating over an array-like object, using the array form of the `ngOptions` syntax
(`item.label for item in items`) and that object contains non-numeric property keys.

In this case these properties with non-numeric keys will be ignored.

** Here array-like is defined by the result of a call to this internal function:
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/v1.4.0-rc.1/src/Angular.js#L198-L211 **

To get the desired behaviour you need to iterate using the object form of the `ngOptions` syntax
(`value.label` for (key, value) in items)`).

As explained in #11781 and #14924, IE11 can (under certain circumstances) break up a text node into
multiple consecutive ones, breaking interpolated expressions (e.g. `{{'foo'}}` would become
`{{` + `'foo'}}`). To work-around this IE11 bug, #11796 introduced extra logic to merge consecutive
text nodes (on IE11 only), which relies on the text nodes' having the same `parentNode`.

This approach works fine in the common case, where `compileNodes` is called with a live NodeList
object, because removing a text node from its parent will automatically update the latter's
`.childNodes` NodeList. It falls short though, when calling `compileNodes` with either a
jqLite/jQuery collection or an Array. In fails in two ways:

1. If the text nodes do not have a parent at the moment of compiling, there will be no merging.
   (This happens for example on directives with `transclude: {...}`.)
2. If the text nodes do have a parent, just removing a text node from its parent does **not** remove
   it from the collection/array, which means that the merged text nodes will still get compiled and
   linked (and possibly be displayed in the view). E.g. `['{{text1}}', '{{text2}}', '{{text3}}']`
   will become `['{{text1}}{{text2}}{{text3}}', '{{text2}}', '{{text3}}']`.

--
This commit works around the above problems by:

1. Merging consecutive text nodes in the provided list, even if they have no parent.
2. When merging a text node, explicitly remove it from the list (unless it is a live, auto-updating
   list).

This can nonetheless have undesirable (albeit rare) side effects by overzealously merging text
nodes that are not meant to be merged (see the ""BREAKING CHANGE"" section below).

Fixes #14924

Closes #15025

BREAKING CHANGE:

**Note:** Everything described below affects **IE11 only**.

Previously, consecutive text nodes would not get merged if they had no parent. They will now, which
might have unexpectd side effects in the following cases:

1. Passing an array or jqLite/jQuery collection of parent-less text nodes to `$compile` directly:

    ```js
    // Assuming:
    var textNodes = [
      document.createTextNode('{{'),
      document.createTextNode('""foo""'),
      document.createTextNode('}}')
    ];
    var compiledNodes = $compile(textNodes)($rootScope);

    // Before:
    console.log(compiledNodes.length);   // 3
    console.log(compiledNodes.text());   // {{'foo'}}

    // After:
    console.log(compiledNodes.length);   // 1
    console.log(compiledNodes.text());   // foo

    // To get the old behavior, compile each node separately:
    var textNodes = [
      document.createTextNode('{{'),
      document.createTextNode('""foo""'),
      document.createTextNode('}}')
    ];
    var compiledNodes = angular.element(textNodes.map(function (node) {
      return $compile(node)($rootScope)[0];
    }));
    ```

2. Using multi-slot transclusion with non-consecutive, default-content text nodes (that form
   interpolated expressions when merged):

   ```js
   // Assuming the following component:
   .compoent('someThing', {
     template: '<ng-transclude><!-- Default content goes here --></ng-transclude>'
     transclude: {
       ignored: 'veryImportantContent'
     }
   })
   ```

   ```html
   <!-- And assuming the following view: -->
   <some-thing>
     {{
     <very-important-content>Nooot</very-important-content>
     'foo'}}
   </some-thing>

   <!-- Before: -->
   <some-thing>
     <ng-transclude>
       {{       <-- Two separate
       'foo'}}  <-- text nodes
     </ng-transclude>
   </some-thing>

   <!-- After: -->
   <some-thing>
     <ng-transclude>
       foo  <-- The text nodes were merged into `{{'foo'}}`, which was then interpolated
     </ng-transclude>
   </some-thing>

   <!-- To (visually) get the old behavior, wrap top-level text nodes on -->
   <!-- multi-slot transclusion directives into `<span>` elements; e.g.: -->
   <some-thing>
     <span>{{</span>
     <very-important-content>Nooot</very-important-content>
     <span>'foo'}}</span>
   </some-thing>

   <!-- Result: -->
   <some-thing>
     <ng-transclude>
       <span>{{</span>       <-- Two separate
       <span>'foo'}}</span>  <-- nodes
     </ng-transclude>
   </some-thing>

For $validate(), it is necessary to store the parseError state
in the controller. Otherwise, if the parser name equals a validator
key, $validate() will assume a parse error occured if the validator
is invalid.

Also, setting the validity for the parser now happens after setting
validity for the validator key. Otherwise, the parse key is set,
and then immediately afterwards the validator key is unset
(because parse errors remove all other validations).

This reverts commit 2428907259fa80ec3b1b4bfd85ea20028a9f4fa5.

We decided to revert this because it is not bullet proof. The issue is
that we can't reliably have both angular and non-angular code in charge
of the DOM. We could work around some issues here and there, but we
can't do it reliably, so it's better not to support DOM manipulation
that happens outside of angular. There is a good chance that once we
integrate with MDVs our possition will change, but until then our
position is that only angular or angular widgets/directives can change
change DOM that was compiled.

It's great that IE11 wants to be compatible enough that it doesn't want
to be special cased and treated differently.

However, as long as one has to have a different code path for IE than
for the other supported browsers, we still need to detect and special
case it.  For instance, our URL parsing code still needs the same
workaround the we used for IE10.  We still see the same Access denied /
TypeError exceptions when setting certain values.  FYI, Angular doesn't
generally blindly test for IE – we also check the version number.

Thanks to modern.ie for the free IE11 test VM.

We've been able to use `querySelectorAll` in all the browsers that we
support for some time now, but we haven't been able to test code that uses
it in the older version of `jsdom` that we were using, until recently.

Besides the general goal of modernizing our code, the impetus for this
specific change is that I'm trying to support testing without having to
render nodes into an actual document. The `.getElementsByName` method is
only defined on `document` and only works if the nodes you care about are
contained by the document.

On the other hand, `querySelectorAll` works on any DOM node, and allows a
more precise selection of just the `<input type=""radio"">` elements that
have the appropriate name.

IE8's implementation of `querySelectorAll` supports attribute-based
selectors, which is all we need here.

allOrNothing interpolation is now used for ng-attr-*, under all circumstances. This prevents
uninitialized attributes from being added to the DOM with invalid values which cause errors
to be shown.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Now, ng-attr-* will never add the attribute to the DOM if any of the interpolated expressions
evaluate to `undefined`.

To work around this, initialize values which are intended to be the empty string with the
empty string:

For example, given the following markup:

    <div ng-attr-style=""border-radius: {{value}}{{units}}""></div>

If $scope.value is `4`, and $scope.units is undefined, the resulting markup is unchanged:

    <div ng-attr-style=""border-radius: {{value}}{{units}}""></div>

However, if $scope.units is `""""`, then the resulting markup is updated:

    <div ng-attr-style=""border-radius: {{value}}{{units}}"" style=""border-radius: 4""></div>

This changes React to throw when `ReactID.getNode()` fails to find a node. This method is used by two call sites:

 - Implements `ReactComponent#getDOMNode`. This method already throws if a component is not mounted, and //all mounted components should be able to find their rendered root nodes//.
 - Used by `ReactDOMIDOperations`. These call sites aleady assume that `getNode` returns a non-null. Currently, if the node is not found, this is the site that fatals (and the stack trace is much harder to debug).

The error message should make it //a lot// easier to debug unexpected DOM trees. In particular, this will help track down all the places where the browser inserts `<tbody>` unexpectedly.

- `autofocus` (should be `autoFocus`, how ironic given the current
situation) on new todo input isn't working. Switched to manual
`focus()` in `componentDidMount` for now.
- More consistent breathing space between lines.
- Gutter at 80.

Added:
- Use todomvc-common base.css. The old one had to change ids to
classes. No longer necessary.
- Give `cx` a better name and move it in `Utils`.
- Trim input upon finishing edit.
- Remove todo if the new edited value is empty.
- Submit edited todo value on input blur.
- README to explain the existence of this example. Being able to
maintain a non-compilant version allows nice deviations from the
todomvc specs, such as animations, in the future.

Most systems use *IETF language tag* codes which are typically a combination

Whilst the `$locale.id` comes close, the lowercase format makes it impossible

to deduce `en_Dsrt_US` from `en-dsrt-us`.

You can create these trees through `React.createElement`. The first
argument is the tag, pass a properties object as the second
argument and children to the third argument.""

to:

""JSX is completely optional; you don't have to use JSX with React.
You can create React elements in plain JavaScript using
`React.createElement`, which takes a tag name or component, a
properties object, and variable number of optional child
arguments.""

and additionally added another child element to the example code.

BREAKING CHANGE: Interpolations inside DOM event handlers are
    disallowed.  DOM event handlers execute arbitrary Javascript code.
    Using an interpolation for such handlers means that the interpolated
    value is a JS string that is evaluated.  Storing or generating such
    strings is error prone and likely leads to an XSS if you're not
    super careful.  On the other hand, ng-click and such event handlers
    evaluate Angular expressions that are a lot safer (e.g. No direct
    access to global objects - only scope), cleaner and harder to
    exploit.

    To migrate the code follow the example below:

    Before:

        JS:   scope.foo = 'alert(1)';
        HTML: <div onclick=""{{foo}}"">

    After:

        JS:   scope.foo = function() { alert(1); }
        HTML: <div ng-click=""foo()"">

Directives which expect to make use of the multi-element grouping feature introduced in
1.1.6 (https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/e46100f7) must now add the property multiElement
to their definition object, with a truthy value.

This enables the use of directive attributes ending with the words '-start' and '-end' for
single-element directives.

BREAKING CHANGE: Directives which previously depended on the implicit grouping between
directive-start and directive-end attributes must be refactored in order to see this same behaviour.

Before:

```
<div data-fancy-directive-start>{{start}}</div>
  <p>Grouped content</p>
<div data-fancy-directive-end>{{end}}</div>

.directive('fancyDirective', function() {
  return {
    link: angular.noop
  };
})
```

After:

```
<div data-fancy-directive-start>{{start}}</div>
  <p>Grouped content</p>
<div data-fancy-directive-end>{{end}}</div>

.directive('fancyDirective', function() {
  return {
    multiElement: true, // Explicitly mark as a multi-element directive.
    link: angular.noop
  };
})

In this particular case it is probably doesn't matter since setState is called directly after mutation, but it does provide a bad example of state mutation.

When multiple animations on the same element are queued before a $digest passes,
the animator tries to create as few actual animations as possible by joining / canceling
redundant animations. Class-based animations for example are cancelled when the classes that
are added and removed are the same, and the result is no class-change. This however must only
happen if there's no structural animation currently queued.

Since it is possible for contributors to edit the commit message before merging it into master, for people who are new to the commit styling system, we should be lenient about minor infractions like forgetting to put docs: in front of a message.

Except on Numbers, Dates and Arrays.

Thanks to @danielkrainas for the initial implementation of this feature.

This behavior is consistent with implementations found in other languages such as Ruby, Python,
and CoffeeScript.
http://rubymonk.com/learning/books/1-ruby-primer/chapters/5-strings/lessons/31-string-basics
https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting-operations
http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/chapters/strings/interpolation

The commit also exposes a private $$stringify method on the angular global, so that ngMessageFormat
can use the same logic without duplicating it.

Fixes #7317
Closes #8350
Fixes #11406

BREAKING CHANGE:

When converting values to strings, interpolation now uses a custom toString() function on objects
that are not Number, Array or Date (custom means that the `toString` function is not the same as
`Object.prototype.toString`). Otherwise, interpolation uses JSON.stringify() as usual.

Should you have a custom toString() function but still want the output of JSON.stringify(),
migrate as shown in the following examples:

Before:

```html
<span>{{myObject}}</span>
```

After - use the `json` filter to stringify the object:

```html
<span>{{myObject | json}}</span>
```

While Closure Compiler generally recommends to maintain the externs for
projects together with their source, this has not worked well for
AngularJS:
- Changes to externs must be tested; they can break clients. AngularJS
  has no testing infrastructure for this.
- Changes mostly come from users inside of Google and are much more
  easily submitted together with the code using them within Google's
  repository.

This change deletes the externs here and adds a README.closure.md to
document the change. They will be added back to Closure Compiler in a
separate submit.

So far, angular.copy was copying all properties including those from
prototype chain and was losing the whole prototype chain (except for Date,
Regexp, and Array).

Deep copy should exclude properties from the prototype chain because it
is useless to do so. When modified, properties from prototype chain are
overwritten on the object itself and will be deeply copied then.

Moreover, preserving prototype chain allows instanceof operator to be
consistent between the source object and the copy.
Before this change,

    var Foo = function() {};
    var foo = new Foo();
    var fooCopy = angular.copy(foo);
    foo instanceof Foo; // => true
    fooCopy instanceof Foo; // => false

Now,

    foo instanceof Foo; // => true
    fooCopy instanceof Foo; // => true

The new behaviour is useful when using $http transformResponse. When
receiving JSON data, we could transform it and instantiate real object
""types"" from it. The transformed response is always copied by Angular.
The old behaviour was losing the whole prototype chain and broke all
""types"" from third-party libraries depending on instanceof.

Closes #5063
Closes #3767
Closes #4996

BREAKING CHANGE:

This changes `angular.copy` so that it applies the prototype of the original
object to the copied object.  Previously, `angular.copy` would copy properties
of the original object's prototype chain directly onto the copied object.

This means that if you iterate over only the copied object's `hasOwnProperty`
properties, it will no longer contain the properties from the prototype.
This is actually much more reasonable behaviour and it is unlikely that
applications are actually relying on this.

If this behaviour is relied upon, in an app, then one should simply iterate
over all the properties on the object (and its inherited properties) and
not filter them with `hasOwnProperty`.

**Be aware that this change also uses a feature that is not compatible with
IE8.**  If you need this to work on IE8 then you would need to provide a polyfill
for `Object.create` and `Object.getPrototypeOf`.

While $location expects that $browser stores the URL unchanged, ""some browsers"" transform the URL

However, it failed to update pendingLocation in all code paths, causing
$browser.url() to sometimes incorrectly report previous URLs, which horribly confused $location.

This fix ensures that pendingLocation is always updated if set, causing url() to report the
current url.

Previously, the special property name that would match against any
property was hard-coded to `$`.
With this commit, the user can specify an arbitrary property name,
by passing a 4th argument to `filterFilter()`. E.g.:

```js
var items = [{foo: 'bar'}, {baz: 'qux'}];
var expr  =  {'%': 'bar'};

console.log(filterFilter(items, expr, null, '%'));   // [{foo: 'bar'}]

 - It is totally standalone with no dependency on React
 - The only usage of this script is in React-Magic and on the HTML to JSX page on the React website (http://facebook.github.io/react/html-jsx.html)

I've hotlinked it from the Github site for that project since this was the easiest way to pull it in.

Due to the fact that Github Pages lacks redirects (among other basic web hosting functionality), I've replaced the `html-jsx-lib.js` file with a comment explaining where the file has moved to, just in case anyone was hotlinking it from the React site.

Note that this behavior only manifests itself in tests, because of course

of `dumpCache`, but it's more idiomatic simply to re-`require` the latest

This copies the propType and contextType validation to a wrapper around the
descriptor factory. By doing the validation early, we make it easier to track
down bugs. It also prepares for static type checking which should be done at the
usage site.

This validation is not yet active and is just logged using monitorCodeUse. This
will allow us to clean up callsites which would fail this new type of
validation.

I chose to copy the validation instead of abstracting it out to a common abstraction. This is just an
intermediate step to avoid spamming consoles. The original validation in the instance will be deleted as soon as we can turn on the warnings at the callsite. Copy+Delete makes this a more a much cleaner diff review/history.

Additionally, getDefaultProps are moved to become a static function which is
only executed once. It should be moved to statics but we don't have a
convenient way to merge mixins in statics right now. Deferring to ES6 classes.

This is still a breaking change since you can return an object or array from
getDefaultProps, which later gets mutated and now the shared instance is
mutated. Mutating an object that is passed into you from props is highly
discouraged and likely to lead to subtle bugs anyway. So I'm not too worried.

The defaultProps are now resolved in the descriptor factory. This will enable
a perf optimizations where we don't create an unnecessary object allocation
when you use default props. It also means that ReactChildren.map has access to
resolved properties which gives them consistent behavior whether or not the
default prop is specified.

This is a breaking change since it can affect how mapping over children and
transferPropsTo works together with defaultProps.

The _owner field is unnecessary since it's reachable from _currentElement.

The _lifeCycle field is unnecessary because an internal component should
not even need to exist at all if it's unmounted. It should be dereferenced
internally, and never exposed externally.

The only case where it's important is for batching updates where we
currently avoid calling performUpdateIfNecessary if it's mounted. However,
this function is already only executed ""if necessary"" so we just make sure
that it's not necessary after unmount by resetting all the pending fields.

Nothing would prevent a user from accidentally calling angular.bootstrap on an element that had already been bootstrapped. If this was done, odd behavior could manifest in an application, causing different scopes to update the same DOM, and causing debugger confusion.

This fix adds a check inside of angular.bootstrap to check if the passed-in element already has an injector, and if so, will throw an error.

When calling `.splice()` without a 2nd argument (`deleteCount`), most browsers will splice to the
end of the array. As it turns out, this is the behavior specified in [ES2015][es6]. In [ES5][es5],
the spec seems to imply that nothing should happen.

To avoid inconsistent behavior among browsers implementing different versions of the EcmaScript
standart or when ES5 shims are included (e.g. https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim/), this commit
ensures that all calls to `.splice()` provide at least two arguments.

Exposing the _renderedChildren property before all the children are fully
mounted. This allows us to debug a partially mounted tree when the debugger
has a breakpoint in the one of the mounting children.

This only has a functional difference in the case where mounting throws. This
will end up not mounting the component anyway. Any remounting shouldn't be
affected by this change.

For more detailed information refer to this document:
https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1pbtW2yvtmFBikfRrJd8VAsabiFkKezmYZ_PbgdjQOVU/edit

**Example:**

```html

{{recipients.length, plural, offset:1
    =0 {You gave no gifts}
    =1 { {{ recipients[0].gender, select,
              male {You gave him a gift.}
              female {You gave her a gift.}
              other {You gave them a gift.}
          }}
       }
    one { {{ recipients[0].gender, select,
              male {You gave him and one other person a gift.}
              female {You gave her and one other person a gift.}
              other {You gave them and one other person a gift.}
          }}
       }
    other {You gave {{recipients[0].gender}} and # other people gifts. }
}}
```

This is a SEPARATE module so you MUST include `angular-messageformat.js`
or `angular-messageformat.min.js`.

In addition, your application module should depend on the ""ngMessageFormat""
(e.g. angular.module('myApp', ['ngMessageFormat']);)

When you use the `ngMessageFormat`, the $interpolate gets overridden with
a new service that adds the new MessageFormat behavior.

**Syntax differences from MessageFormat:**

- MessageFormat directives are always inside `{{ }}` instead of
  single `{ }`.  This ensures a consistent interpolation syntax (else you
  could interpolate in more than one way and have to pick one based on
  the features availability for that syntax.)
- The first part of such a syntax can be an arbitrary Angular
  expression instead of a single identifier.
- You can nest them as deep as you want.  As mentioned earlier, you
  would use `{{ }}` to start the nested interpolation that may optionally
  include select/plural extensions.
- Only `select` and `plural` keywords are currently recognized.
- Quoting support is coming in a future commit.
- Positional arguments/placeholders are not supported. They don't make
  sense in Angular templates anyway (they are only helpful when using
  API calls from a programming language.)
- Redefining of the startSymbol (`{{`) and endSymbol (`}}`) used for
  interpolation is not yet supported.

The $location service is designed to support hash prefixed URLs
for cases where the browser does not support HTML5 push-state navigation.

The Google Ajax Crawling Scheme expects that local paths within a SPA start
with a hash-bang (e.g. `somedomain.com/base/path/#!/client/side/path`).

The `$locationProvide` allows the application developer to configure the
hashPrefix, and it is normal to set this to a bang '!', but the default
has always been the empty string ''.

This has caused some confusion where a user is not aware of this feature
and wonders why adding a hash value to the location (e.g. `$location.hash('xxx')`)
results in a double hash: `##xxx`.

This commit changes the default value of the prefix to '!', which is more
natural and expected.

See https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/getting-started

Closes #13812
Closes #14202

BREAKING CHANGE

The hash-prefix for `$location` hash-bang URLs has changed from the empty
string """" to the bang ""!"". If your application does not use HTML5 mode
or is being run on browsers that do not support HTML5 mode, and you have
not specified your own hash-prefix then client side URLs will now contain
a ""!"" prefix. For example, rather than `mydomain.com/#/a/b/c` will become
`mydomain/#!/a/b/c`.

If you actually wanted to have no hash-prefix then you should configure
this by adding a configuration block to you application:

```
appModule.config(['$locationProvider', function($locationProvider) {
  $locationProvider.hashPrefix("""");
}]);
```

We need to use ReactLegacyDescriptor because the constructor here will be a

Via transclusion, svg elements can occur outside an `<svg>` container in an
Angular template but are put into an `<svg>` container through compilation
and linking.

E.g.
Given that `svg-container` is a transcluding directive with
the following template:
```
<svg ng-transclude></svg>
```

The following markup creates a `<circle>` inside of an `<svg>` element
during runtime:
```
<svg-container>
  <circle></circle>
</svg-container>
```

However, this produces non working `<circle>` elements, as svg elements
need to be created inside of an `<svg>` element.

This change detects for most cases the correct namespace of transcluded content
and recreates that content in the correct `<svg>` container
when needed during compilation. For special cases it adds an addition argument
to `$transclude` that allows to specify the future parent node of elements
that will be cloned and attached using the `cloneAttachFn`.

  Before:

This makes it possible to access a form from a controller

Change the way parse works from the old mechanism to a multiple stages
parsing and code generation. The new parse is a four stages parsing
* Lexer
* AST building
* AST processing
* Cacheing, one-time binding and `$watch` optimizations

The Lexer phase remains unchanged.

AST building phase follows Mozilla Parse API [1] and generates an AST that
is compatible. The only exception was needed for `filters` as JavaScript
does not support filters, in this case, a filter is transformed into a
`CallExpression` that has an extra property named `filter` with the value
of `true`.

The AST processing phase transforms the AST into a function that can be
executed to evaluate the expression. The logic for expressions remains
unchanged. The AST processing phase works in two different ways depending
if csp is enabled or disabled. If csp is enabled, the processing phase
returns pre-generated function that interpret specific parts of the AST.
When csp is disabled, then the entire expression is compiled into a single
function that is later evaluated using `Function`. In both cases, the
returning function has the properties `constant`, `literal` and `inputs`
as in the previous implementation. These are used in the next phase to
perform different optimizations.

The cacheing, one-time binding and `$watch` optimizations phase remains
mostly unchanged.

currently encodes semicolons. This can cause an infinite digest to occur since $location
is comparing the internal semicolon-encoded url with the semicolon-unencoded url returned
from window.location.href, causing Angular to believe the url is changing with each digest
loop.

This fix adds "";"" to the list of characters to unencode after encoding queries or path segments.

This reverts commit cad717b1171affc3d540cea372576c70b0cb2295.

This change causes regressions in existing code and after closer inspection
I realized that it is trying to fix an issue that is should not be considered
a valid issue.

The location service was designed to work against either ""hash"" part of the
window.location when in the hashbang mode or full url when in the html5 mode.

This change tries to merge the two modes partially, which is not right. One
reason for this is that the search part of window.location can't be modified
while in the hashbang mode (a browser limitation), so with this change part
of the search object should be immutable and read-only which will only cause
more confusion.

Instead of using a counter and an extra watch, just schedule the reaction function via .

This gives us the same/similar ordering and coalecsing of updates as counter without the extra
overhead. Also the code is easier to read.

Since interpolation uses watchGroup, this change additionally improves performance of interpolation.

In large table benchmark digest cost went down by 15-20% for interpolation.

When ngModel is set to a value that matches a disabled option, ngOptions will now select the option
in the select element, which will set select.val() to the option hash value and visually
show the option value / label as selected in the select box. Previously, disabled
options forced the unknown value.
The previous behavior is inconsistent with both default HTML behavior and select with
ngModel but without ngOptions. Both allow disabled values to be selected programmatically.

A common use case for this behavior is an option that was previously valid, but has
been disabled, and cannot be selected again.

This commit removes a duplicate test, and all other tests that previously checked that disabled
options are not set have been adjusted to the ensure the opposite.

`module.decorator` is now processed via the configBlocks order of operations and:
  1. no longer throws error if declared before the provider being decorated.
  2. guarantees the correct provider will be decorated when multiple, same-name
  providers are defined.

(1) Prior to this fix, declaring `module.decorator` before the provider that it
decorates results in throwing an error:

```js
angular
  .module('theApp', [])
  .decorator('theFactory', moduleDecoratorFn)
  .factory('theFactory', theFactoryFn);

// Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module theApp due to:
// Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: theFactoryProvider
```

The result of this fix now allows for the declaration order above.

(2) Prior to this fix, declaring `module.decorator` before the final, same-named
provider results in that provider **not** being decorated as expected:

**NOTE:** Angular does not use provider name spacing, so the final declared
provider is selected if multiple, same-named providers are declared.

```js
angular
  .module('theApp', [])
  .factory('theFactory', theFactoryFn)
  .decorator('theFactory', moduleDecoratorFn)
  .factory('theFactory', theOtherFactoryFn);
```

`theOtherFactoryFn` is selected as 'theFactory' provider, but prior to this fix it is **not**
decorated via `moduleDecoratorFn`. This fix ensures that `theOtherFactoryFn` will be decorated as
expected when using the declaration order above.

Closes #12382
Closes #14348

BREAKING CHANGE:

`module.decorator` declarations are now processed as part of the `module.config`
queue and may result in providers being decorated in a different order if
`module.config` blocks are also used to decorate providers via
`$provide.decorator`.

For example, consider the following declaration order in which 'theFactory' is
decorated by both a `module.decorator` and a `$provide.decorator`:

```js
angular
  .module('theApp', [])
  .factory('theFactory', theFactoryFn)
  .config(function($provide) {
    $provide.decorator('theFactory', provideDecoratorFn);
  })
  .decorator('theFactory', moduleDecoratorFn);
```

Prior to this fix, 'theFactory' provider would be decorated in the following
order:
  1. moduleDecoratorFn
  2. provideDecoratorFn

The result of this fix changes the order in which 'theFactory' is decorated
because now `module.decorator` declarations are processed in the same order as
`module.config` declarations:
  1. provideDecoratorFn
  2. moduleDecoratorFn

When I first read these docs, it was not immediately clear to me that I could
use `React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup` to animate a single item coming into view,
or an item replacing an item already there. This was partly due to the example
which rendered a list of items.

This PR adds a blurb about being able to use
`React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup` with one or zero items, provides a code
example, and adds a note blockquote that a `key` attribute must always be
provided on each child of `React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup`. The latter point
was not immediately obvious from the original `TodoList` code example, since it
renders a list which would normally require `key` attributes anyway.

Test Plan:
- Refreshed `http://localhost:4000/react/docs/animation.html`, saw that the
  docs additions rendered correctly.
- Example code not tested (it was extracted from working code).

Old behavior: actions can be either cancellable or have a numeric timeout.
When having both defined, cancellable was ignored.
With this commit: it's possible for actions to have both cancellable:true
and numeric timeout defined.

Example usage:

```js
var Post = $resource('/posts/:id', {id: '@id'}, {
  get: {
    method: 'GET',
    cancellable: true,
    timeout: 10000
  }
});

var currentPost = Post.get({id: 1});
...
// the next request can cancel the previous one
currentPost.$cancelRequest();
currentPost = Post.get({id: 2});

// any of those requests will also timeout, if the response
// doesn't come within 10 seconds
```

Step support works like min / max, but with the following caveat.
Currently, only Firefox fully implements the spec. Other browsers
(Chrome, Safari, Edge) have issues when the step value changes
after the input has been changed. They do not adjust the input value
to a valid value, but instead set the stepMismatch validity state.

Angular will take this validity state, and forward it as the ngModel
""step"" error. Adjusting the error ourselves would add too much code,
as the logic is quite involved.

Prior to this fix it was impossible to apply a binding to a the
ngMessage directive to represent the name of the error. It was also
not possible to use ngRepeat or any other structural directive to
dynamically update the list of messages. This feature patch ensures
that both ngMessages can render expressions and automatically update
when any dynamic message data changes.

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `ngMessagesInclude` attribute is now its own directive and that must
be placed as a **child** element within the element with the ngMessages
directive. (Keep in mind that the former behaviour of the
ngMessageInclude attribute was that all **included** ngMessage template
code was placed at the **bottom** of the element containing the
ngMessages directive; therefore to make this behave in the same way,
place the element containing the ngMessagesInclude directive at the
end of the container containing the ngMessages directive).

```html
<!-- AngularJS 1.3.x -->
<div ng-messages=""model.$error"" ng-messages-include=""remote.html"">
  <div ng-message=""required"">Your message is required</div>
</div>

<!-- AngularJS 1.4.x -->
<div ng-messages=""model.$error"">
  <div ng-message=""required"">Your message is required</div>
  <div ng-messages-include=""remote.html""></div>

This reverts commit c81d8176cc55cd15acae05259ead73f90a01f0b7.

This commit causes several issues (#1651, #1674, #1662) and doesn't even
contain a test that proves that anything on Opera got actually fixed.

If the original Opera resurfaces, we'll fix it properly.

The fix for removing the event callbacks on destroy introduced in
ce7f400011e1e2e1b9316f18ce87b87b79d878b4 removed the events too early, so that the event callbacks
for the ""close"" phase in ""leave"" animations were not called.

This commit fixes the behavior so that the event callbacks are only removed during on('$destroy')
when no animation is currently active on the element. When an animation is active, the event callbacks
will be removed after all callbacks have run, and if the element has no parent (has been removed from
the DOM).

BREAKING CHANGE:

Ever since 0df93fd, tagged in v1.0.0rc1, the ngSwitch directive has had an undocumented `change`
attribute, used for evaluating a scope expression when the switch value changes.

While it's unlikely, applications which may be using this feature should work around the removal
by adding a custom directive which will perform the eval instead. Directive controllers are
re-instantiated when being transcluded, so by putting the attribute on each item that you want
to be notified of a change to, you can more or less emulate the old behaviour.

Example:

```js
angular.module(""switchChangeWorkaround"", []).
  directive(""onSwitchChanged"", function() {
    return {
      linke: function($scope, $attrs) {
        $scope.$parent.$eval($attrs.change);
      }
    };
  });
```

```html
<div ng-switch=""switcher"">
  <div ng-switch-when=""a"" on-switch-changed=""doSomethingInParentScope()""></div>
  <div ng-switch-when=""b"" on-switch-changed=""doSomethingInParentScope()""></div>
</div>
```

And the old test about mouseenter/mouseleave is wrong too. It just
triggers mouseover and mouseout events, cannot describe the process of mouse
moving from one element to another element, which is important for
mouseenter/mouseleave.

the fix simply removes all classes that were added previously by
ng:class and add classes that the ng:class expression evaluates to.

we can now guarantee that we won't clobber stuff added before or after
compilation as long as all class names are unique.

in order to implement this I had to beef up jqLite#addClass and
jqLite#removeClass to be able to add/remove multiple classes without
creating duplicates.

X-Requested-With header is rarely used in practice and by using
it all the time we are triggering preflight checks for crossdomain
requests.

We could try detecting if we are doing CORS requests or not, but
it doesn't look like it's worth the trouble.

BREAKING CHANGE: X-Requested-With header is not set by $http service
any more. If anyone actually uses this header it's quite easy to add
it back via:

```

BREAKING CHANGE

ngAnimate addClass / removeClass animations are now applied right away. This means
that as soon as the animation starts the class will be added (addClass) or removed
(removeClass) to the element being animated instead of after the -add-active /
-remove-active animations are completed. This allows for animations outside of
ngAnimate to not conflict with $animate.

This commit introduces beforeAddClass and beforeRemoveClass animation event functions and
executes any addClass and removeClass event functions AFTER the class has been added or
removed (this is opposite functionality of how ngAnimate used to work when performing
JS-enabled animations addClass / removeClass animations). If your animation code relies on
any animations being performed prior to the class change then simply use the new
beforeAddClass and beforeRemoveClass animation event functions.

Finally, when animating show and hide animations using CSS transitions or keyframe animations,
ng-hide-remove doesn't require `display:block!important` for ng-hide-add anymore.

This commit disables promise unwrapping and adds
$parseProvider.unwrapPromises() getter/setter api that allows developers
to turn the feature back on if needed. Promise unwrapping support will
be removed from Angular in the future and this setting only allows for
enabling it during transitional period.

If the unwrapping is enabled, Angular will log a warning about each
expression that unwraps a promise (to reduce the noise, each expression
is logged only onces). To disable this logging use
`$parseProvider.logPromiseWarnings(false)`.

Previously promises found anywhere in the expression during expression
evaluation would evaluate to undefined while unresolved and to the
fulfillment value if fulfilled.

This is a feature that didn't prove to be wildly useful or popular,
primarily because of the dichotomy between data access in templates
(accessed as raw values) and controller code (accessed as promises).

In most code we ended up resolving promises manually in controllers
or automatically via routing and unifying the model access in this way.

Other downsides of automatic promise unwrapping:

- when building components it's often desirable to receive the
  raw promises
- adds complexity and slows down expression evaluation
- makes expression code pre-generation unattractive due to the
  amount of code that needs to be generated
- makes IDE auto-completion and tool support hard
- adds too much magic

BREAKING CHANGE: $parse and templates in general will no longer
automatically unwrap promises. This feature has been deprecated and
if absolutely needed, it can be reenabled during transitional period
via `$parseProvider.unwrapPromises(true)` api.

This problem is beset by the problem of `ngModel` expecting models  to be
atomic things (primitives/objects).

> When it was first invented it was expected that ngModel would only be
a primitive, e.g. a string or a number. Later when things like ngList and
ngOptions were added or became more complex then various hacks were put
in place to make it look like it worked well with those but it doesn't.

-------------

Just to be clear what is happening, lets name the objects:

```js
var option1 = { uid: 1, name: 'someName1' };
var option2 = { uid: 2, name: 'someName2' };
var option3 = { uid: 3, name: 'someName3' };

var initialItem = { uid: 1, name: 'someName1' };

model {
  options: [option1, option2, option3],
  selected: initialItem
};
```

Now when we begin we have:

```js
expect(model.selected).toBe(initialItem);
expect(model.selected.uid).toEqual(option1.uid);
expect(model.selected).not.toBe(option1);
```

So although `ngOptions` has found a match between an option and the
modelValue, these are not the same object.

Now if we change the properties of the `model.selected` object, we are
effectively changing the `initialItem` object.

```js
model.selected.uid = 3;
model.selected.name = 'someName3';

expect(model.selected).toBe(initialItem);
expect(model.selected.uid).toEqual(option3.uid);
expect(model.selected).not.toBe(option3);
```

At the moment `ngModel` only watches for changes to the object identity
and so it doesn't trigger an update to the `ngOptions` directive.

This commit fixes this in `ngOptions` by adding a **deep** watch on the
`attr.ngModel` expression...

```js
scope.$watch(attr.ngModel, updateOptions, true);
```

You can see that in this Plunker:
http://plnkr.co/edit/0PE7qN5FXIA23y4RwyN0?p=preview

-------

But this isn't the end of the story. Since `ngModel` and `ngOptions` did
not make copies between the model and the view, we can't go around just
changing the properties of the `model.selected` object. This is particularly
important in the situation where the user has actually chosen an option,
since the `model.selected` points directly to one of the option objects:

```js
// User selects ""someName2"" option
expect(model.selected).toBe(option2);
expect(model.selected.uid).toEqual(option2.uid);
expect(model.selected).not.toBe(initialOption);
```

If we now change the `model.selected` object's properties we are actually
changing the `option2` object:

```js
expect(model.selected).toBe(option2);

model.selected.uid = 3;
model.selected.name = 'someName3';

expect(model.selected).toBe(option2);
expect(model.selected).not.toBe(option3);

expect(option2.uid).toEqual(3);
expect(option2.name).toEqual('someName3');
```

which means that the options are now broken:

```js
expect(model.options).toEqual([
  { uid: 1, name: 'someName1' },
  { uid: 3, name: 'someName3' },
  { uid: 3, name: 'someName3' }
]);
```

This commit fixes this in `ngOptions` by making copies when reading the
value if `track by` is being used. If we are not using `track by` then
we really do care about the identity of the object and should not be
copying...

It's not always possible to update `rootElementsByReactRootID` when the

this bookkeeping is just trying to warn about potentially problematic

new element with the same ID is logically the same element, this diff
avoids warning in such cases.

these values will be passed through.

Only cases when the number filter is chained with another filter that doesn't expect null/undefined will be affected. This
should be very rare.

This change will not change the visual output of the filter because the interpolation will convert the null/undefined to
an empty string.

- ""this"" always means the current chain scope inside a DSL

- addFutureAction callbacks now take ($window, $document, done)

- $document has a special method elements() that uses the currently selected nodes in the document as defined by using() statements.

- $document.elements() allows placeholder insertion into selectors to make them more readable.
  ex. $document.elements('input[name=""$1""]', myVar) will substitute the value of myVar for $1 in the selector. Subsequent arguments are $2 and so on.

- $document.elements() results have a special method trigger(event) which should be used to events. This method implements some hacks to make sure browser UI controls update and the correct angular events fire.

- futures now allow custom formatting. By default any chain that results in a future can use toJson() or fromJson() to convert the future value to and from json. A custom parser can be provided with parsedWith(fn) where fn is a callback(value) that must return the parsed result.

Note: The entire widgets.html UI is now able to be controlled and asserted through DSL statements!!! Victory! :)

We don't really see this result in benchmarks (https://www.dropbox.com/s/76wxqbvduade52s/big_table_benchmark_b1ee5396_vs_d580a954.zip?dl=0)
However, it's basically harmless.

Side effects:

Use strict equality check for `undefined` to replace with empty string. Most target browsers will output `undefined` rather than the empty
string if we don't do this. Previously, ngBindTemplate did not perform this check. However the change has been made to make behaviour
consistent across all target browsers (chrome does output the empty string).

When multiple responses are received within a short window from each other, it can be wasteful to
perform full dirty-checking cycles for each individual response. In order to prevent this, it is
now possible to coalesce calls to $apply for responses which occur close together.

This behaviour is opt-in, and the default is disabled, in order to avoid breaking tests or
applications.

In order to activate coalesced apply in tests or in an application, simply perform the following
steps during configuration.

   angular.module('myFancyApp', []).
     config(function($httpProvider) {
       $httpProvider.useApplyAsync(true);
     });

Certain versions of IE inexplicably trigger an input event in response to a placeholder
being set.

It is not possible to sniff for this behaviour nicely as the event is not triggered if
the element is not attached to the document, and the event triggers asynchronously so
it is not possible to accomplish this without deferring DOM compilation and slowing down
load times.

All of ngAnimate has been rewritten to make the internals of the
animation code more flexible, reuseable and performant.

BREAKING CHANGE: JavaSript and CSS animations can no longer be run in
parallel. With earlier versions of ngAnimate, both CSS and JS animations
would be run together when multiple animations were detected. This
feature has now been removed, however, the same effect, with even more
possibilities, can be achieved by injecting `$animateCss` into a
JavaScript-defined animation and creating custom CSS-based animations
from there. Read the ngAnimate docs for more info.

BREAKING CHANGE: The function params for `$animate.enabled()` when an
element is used are now flipped. This fix allows the function to act as
a getter when a single element param is provided.

```js
// < 1.4
$animate.enabled(false, element);

// 1.4+
$animate.enabled(element, false);
```

BREAKING CHANGE: In addition to disabling the children of the element,
`$animate.enabled(element, false)` will now also disable animations on
the element itself.

BREAKING CHANGE: Animation-related callbacks are now fired on
`$animate.on` instead of directly being on the element.

```js
// < 1.4
element.on('$animate:before', function(e, data) {
  if (data.event === 'enter') { ... }
});
element.off('$animate:before', fn);

// 1.4+
$animate.on(element, 'enter', function(data) {
  //...
});
$animate.off(element, 'enter', fn);
```

BREAKING CHANGE: There is no need to call `$scope.$apply` or
`$scope.$digest` inside of a animation promise callback anymore
since the promise is resolved within a digest automatically (but a
digest is not run unless the promise is chained).

```js
// < 1.4
$animate.enter(element).then(function() {
  $scope.$apply(function() {
    $scope.explode = true;
  });
});

// 1.4+
$animate.enter(element).then(function() {
  $scope.explode = true;
});
```

BREAKING CHANGE: When an enter, leave or move animation is triggered then it
will always end any pending or active parent class based animations
(animations triggered via ngClass) in order to ensure that any CSS
styles are resolved in time.

New validation when directive.restrict is specified:

Cases which previously silently failed (now throw an error):
* values with an indexOf method (such as strings, arrays) which returned

Originally, this issue was regarding documenting `restrict: 'CM'` in the directive guide, but it
was pointed out that the restrict documentation is covered in the $compile documentation. Because of
this, a link was simply added to the $compile documentation.

However, the wording suggests that it's actually linking to the directive registration function, in
$compileProvider, so the docs will link there instead. There is a link only a paragraph below to the
$compile documentation, so this does not hurt.

This one is interesting because we have transaction objects being passed around everywhere in the codebase but there's actually no Transaction class. It's a ""mixin"" that comes to life by being Object.assigned to the prototype of a real ""class"" (before class was cool!). Therefore, we can't just say `var Transaction = require('Transaction'); (transaction: Transaction) => { }` because it would be the object that contains a mixin and not an instance of a transaction.

The trick I use is to export `TransactionType` and alias it to `Transaction` in the file as it doesn't actually require transaction. In case they do, we'll figure it out, but in the few files I looked at, it doesn't seem to be the case.

For the perform function, it actually typechecks pretty well!"

It will be re-applied for `v1.6.x`, with a breaking change notice and possibly a way to disable

The gulp bower task in the docs app was never actually running since it couldn't
find the bower.json file and was silently failing. Updating to a newer bower
highlighted this issue.

This commit moves the docs app specific bower components into the docs folder.
There are only jquery and closure compiler related components in the project
folder now.

It also improves the gulp bower task to provide better feedback of progress
and errors.

Summary:
This is a proposal based loosely on the discussions I've had with @paulshen and @jwalke. It implements a shim for `React.DOM.input` (used as `<input>`) that supports two different use cases depending on whether `value` is provided or not.

If a `value` is //not// provided, the input will be initialized with the empty string (or `defaultValue`) and anytime the user changes the input, the `onChange` (or `onTextChange`) handler will be fired and the DOM will reflect the new changes.

  React.renderComponent(
    <input type=""text"" defaultValue=""Untitled"" onTextChange={handleChange} />,
    container
  );

If a `value` is provided, the input will be initialized to that value. Anytime the user changes the input, the `onChange` (or `onTextChange`) handler will be fired. However, the DOM will //not// reflect the new changes. If a `value` is provided, it is the responsibility of the owner to update the `value` prop passed in.

  var value = ""Untitled"";
  var input = React.renderComponent(
    <input type=""text"" value={value} onTextChange={handleChange} />,
    container
  );
  function handleChange(event) {
    // Do something cool like strip out non-numbers.
    var value = event.target.value.replace(/\D/g, '');
    input.setProps({value: value});
  }

This is just a start and we should build similar components for `textarea` and `select`. Also, this does not inject the new components because the changes are not backward compatible. Once we change all `<input>` uses to use `ReactDOMInput`, then we can inject.

ReactTextComponent's implementation is DOM-specific; instead of flattenChildren creating the ReactTextComponent instances, ReactNativeComponent now takes care of having ReactTextComponent injected and creating the component instance. I also renamed ReactTextComponent to ReactDOMTextComponent and moved it to browser/ui/ where it belongs. ReactDOMTextComponent no longer inherits directly from ReactComponent and instead implements construct and {mount,receive,unmount}Component directly.

This diff removes `ReactTestUtils.isTextComponent` which should have previously never returned true when using public APIs.

Test Plan: jest, use ballmer-peak example.

Since commit a3a7afd3aa70d981b0210088df53fa2cf68d3a3d, animations are not run
when the document is hidden (only their structural or class change effects are executed).
However, some libraries rely on the $animate.on() callbacks to be called even when no actual animation
runs.
This commit restores the behavior for the ngAnimate.$animate functions.
Note that callbacks still won't be called if animations are disabled, because this would be be a potential
breaking change, as some applications might rely on this implementation.

which is clearly a mess.  The best solution is not to use {@link} tags
for external links and just use the standard markdown syntax:

```
[Google](http://www.google.com)
```

In the long run, we could look into configuring or modifying `marked` not
to convert these external links or we could provide a ""pre-parser""
processor that dealt with such links before `marked` gets its hands on it.

This makes ReactDOM a simple helper for creating ReactElements with the string tag as the type. The actual class is internal and created by instantiateReactComponent. Configurable using injection.

There's not a separate class for each tag. There's just a generic ReactDOMComponent which could take any tag name.

Invididual tags can be wrapped. When wrapping happens you can return the same tag again. If the wrapper returns the same string, then we fall back to the generic component. This avoids recursion in a single level wrapper.

The latter is possible with controlled inputs when:

 - `ChangeEventPlugin` dispatches `onChange`.
 - A handler responds via `this.setState` with a non-string value (e.g. a number).

A dynamic value can be provided as a key to a child. Either as part of an object
or key property. This becomes part of the component's ID.

We have to be careful to escape this key before inserting it into the DOM since
it could become a vulnerability. We fixed this by escaping just the keys.

However, the current implementation breaks when you used escaped keys. The
internal value is escaped and the value used by getAttributeNode and
getElementById are both unescaped.

This fixes that by keeping the unescaped value internally but escaping it right
before the HTML is generated (like any other attribute).

This is important since business logic IDs (that should be used as keys)
contains characters that need to be escaped.

When ngAnimate is used, it will defer changes to classes until postDigest. Previously,
AngularJS (when ngAnimate is not loaded) would always immediately perform these DOM
operations.

Now, even when the ngAnimate module is not used, if $rootScope is in the midst of a
digest, class manipulation is deferred. This helps reduce jank in browsers such as
IE11.

BREAKING CHANGE:

The $animate class API will always defer changes until the end of the next digest. This allows ngAnimate
to coalesce class changes which occur over a short period of time into 1 or 2 DOM writes, rather than
many. This prevents jank in browsers such as IE, and is generally a good thing.

If you're finding that your classes are not being immediately applied, be sure to invoke $digest().

Some modules used to assume that the angular helpers would always be available when their script was
executed. This could be a problem when using `angular-loader` and the module file happened to get
loaded before the core `angular.js` file.
This commit fixes the issue by delaying the access to angular helpers, until they are guaranteed to
be available.

Affected modules:
- `ngAnimate`
- `ngMessageFormat`
- `ngMessages`
- `ngRoute`
- `ngSanitize`

Fixes #9140

- No need to mention React, you know you're working with it =).
- Wrap code elements in back ticks, so that they get the ""box"" styling for md.
- You'd want the snippet to work inside the live editor, so you need to `renderComponent`. As per wiki specification, the DOM element on which to mount is `mountNode`, just like on the front page.
- Don't forget the JSX pragma, or else your `render` fails.
- Nitpick: empty line after the end of md.
- No need for jQuery reference since
  1. The general mood around React is that you don't need jQuery.
  2. The syntax' still clear without jQuery.
  3. We're doing a jQuery integration entry =).
- `getInitialState` was absent.
- You don't need `componentWillMount` here. fetch them in `getInitialState`.
- The non-spoken convention seems to call the event handler `""handle"" + eventName`. So `handleResize` clearly indicates it's a `resize` handler while `updateDimensions` might do something else. This latter name might actually be better under circumstances where you use call the method directly somewhere, but since we removed the only direct usage in `componentWillMount` this is fine.
- Went OCD again and tried to keep the code short. `width` is enough of a demo. Removed `height`.
- Distinguish between DOM events and React events. Wish we go full React events in a near future.

This commit was produced by squash of more commits, here are the old messages:

- Change tests to use update() instead of parse().
- First implementation of update() method
- Test for update() with object parameter
- Add new tests for location, refactor location code
- Add tests for updateHash()
- Implement updateHash()
- Take one or two arguments, could be string - update hashPath, or hash object - update hashSearch...
- Fixed other service tests, to use new $location.update()
Added $location.cancel() method (with test)
Added $location.parse() for back compatability

sync caching in ng:view must be reverted becase ng:view uses
$route.onChange to listen for changes.

$route fires all onChange events before it calls $become(Controller)
which means that if the template being included via ng:view contains
ng:controller, ng:include or other widget that create new scopes,
these scopes will be created and initialized before the parent scope
is fully initialized (happens after $become is called).

For this reason ng:view must be async.

The new scope implemenetation will resolve this issue by providing
us with an api to register one-off tasks to be executed during the
flush phase. We'll be able to compile and link the included template
safely at this time.

Component(props, child1, child2, arrayOfChildren, child3) ->

This can avoid an additional heap allocation for the unflat array.

It allows you to pass nested arrays and objects like you used to. Those
aren't immediately flattened. That makes this a fairly safe change.

Passing a dynamic array without key properties will yield a warning
(once). Might consider throwing later.

Once we change the transpiler to use the new syntax, you'll end up with
a single flat array in normal usage.

This doesn't actually update the JSX transform.

Angular applications, this new helper provides a simpler method for
defining such directives. By using sensible, widely accepted, conventions
the number of parameters needed has been cut down dramatically.

Many component directives can now be defined by simply providing a `name`,
`template`/`templateUrl`, a `controller`, and `bindings`:

```js
myMod.component('myComp', {
  template: '<div>My name is {{myComp.name}}</div>',
  controller: function() {
  },

This fixes issues where a parser calls $setViewValue. This is a common
strategy for manipulating the $viewValue while the user is entering
data into an input field.

When the $viewValue was changed inside the parser, the new viewValue
would be committed, parsed and used for validation. The original parser
however would run after that and pass the original (outdated) viewValue
on to the validators, which could cause false positives, e.g. for
minlength.

0e001084ffff8674efad289d37cb16cc4e46b50a,angular/angular.js,1440428480,120,2015-08-24 15:01:20 UTC,"fix(ngModel): validate pattern against the viewValue

Since the HTML5 pattern validation constraint validates the input value,
we should also validate against the viewValue. While this worked in
core up to Angular 1.2, in 1.3, we changed not only validation,
but the way `input[date]` and `input[number]` are handled - they parse
their input values into `Date` and `Number` respectively, which cannot
be validated by a regex.

Fixes #12344

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `ngPattern` and `pattern` directives will validate the regex
against the `viewValue` of `ngModel`, i.e. the value of the model
before the $parsers are applied. Previously, the modelValue
(the result of the $parsers) was validated.

This fixes issues where `input[date]` and `input[number]` cannot
be validated because the viewValue string is parsed into
`Date` and `Number` respectively (starting with Angular 1.3).
It also brings the directives in line with HTML5 constraint
validation, which validates against the input value.

This change is unlikely to cause applications to fail, because even
in Angular 1.2, the value that was validated by pattern could have
been manipulated by the $parsers, as all validation was done
inside this pipeline.

If you rely on the pattern being validated against the modelValue,
you must create your own validator directive that overwrites
the built-in pattern validator:

```
.directive('patternModelOverwrite', function patternModelOverwriteDirective() {
  return {
    restrict: 'A',
    require: '?ngModel',
    priority: 1,
    compile: function() {
      var regexp, patternExp;

      return {
        pre: function(scope, elm, attr, ctrl) {
          if (!ctrl) return;

          attr.$observe('pattern', function(regex) {
            /**
             * The built-in directive will call our overwritten validator
             * (see below). We just need to update the regex.
             * The preLink fn guaranetees our observer is called first.
             */
            if (isString(regex) && regex.length > 0) {
              regex = new RegExp('^' + regex + '$');
            }

            if (regex && !regex.test) {
              //The built-in validator will throw at this point
              return;
            }

            regexp = regex || undefined;
          });

        },
        post: function(scope, elm, attr, ctrl) {
          if (!ctrl) return;

          regexp, patternExp = attr.ngPattern || attr.pattern;

          //The postLink fn guarantees we overwrite the built-in pattern validator
          ctrl.$validators.pattern = function(value) {
            return ctrl.$isEmpty(value) ||
              isUndefined(regexp) ||
              regexp.test(value);
          };
        }
      };
    }
  };
});

Fixes issue with isolate scope leaking all over the place into other directives on the same element.

Isolate scope is now available only to the isolate directive that requested it and its template.

A non-isolate directive should not get the isolate scope of an isolate directive on the same element,
instead they will receive the original scope (which is the parent scope of the newly created isolate scope).

Paired with Tobias.

BREAKING CHANGE: Directives without isolate scope do not get the isolate scope from an isolate directive on the same element. If your code depends on this behavior (non-isolate directive needs to access state from within the isolate scope), change the isolate directive to use scope locals to pass these explicitly.

// before

In cases when we reuse elements in a repeater but associate
them with a new scope (see #933 - repeating over array of
primitives) it's possible for the internal ngModel state and
the scope state to get out of sync. This change ensure that
the two are always sync-ed up even in cases where we
reassociate an element with a different (but similar) scope.

In the case of repeating over array of primitives it's still
possible to run into issue if we iterate over primitives and
use form controls or similar widgets without ngModel - oh well,
we'd likely need a special repeater for primitives to deal
with this properly, even then there might be cornercases.

**Major reworking of select and ngOptions**:

* The `SelectController` is now used as an abstraction for the `select` and `ngOptions` directives
to override to get their desired behaviour
* The `select` directive is completely oblivious to the ngOptions directive now - the `ngOptions`
directive could be deleted without having to make any changes to the `select` directive.
* Select related directives (single/multiple/ngOptions) can provide specific versions of
`SelectController.writeValue` and `SelectController.readValue`, which are responsible for getting
the `$viewValue` in or out of the actual `<select>` element and its `<option>` children.

BREAKING CHANGE:

When using `ngOptions`: the directive applies a surrogate key as the value of the `<option>` element.
This commit changes the actual string used as the surrogate key. We now store a string that is computed
by calling `hashKey` on the item in the options collection; previously it was the index or key of the
item in the collection.

(This is in keeping with the way that the unknown option value is represented in the select directive.)

Before you might have seen:

```
<select ng-model=""x"" ng-option=""i in items"">
  <option value=""1"">a</option>
  <option value=""2"">b</option>
  <option value=""3"">c</option>
  <option value=""4"">d</option>
</select>
```

Now it will be something like:

```
<select ng-model=""x"" ng-option=""i in items"">
  <option value=""string:a"">a</option>
  <option value=""string:b"">b</option>
  <option value=""string:c"">c</option>
  <option value=""string:d"">d</option>
</select>
```

If your application code relied on this value, which it shouldn't, then you will need to modify your
application to accommodate this. You may find that you can use the `track by` feaure of `ngOptions`
as this provides the ability to specify the key that is stored.

BREAKING CHANGE:

When iterating over an object's properties using the `(key, value) in obj` syntax
the order of the elements used to be sorted alphabetically. This was an artificial
attempt to create a deterministic ordering since browsers don't guarantee the order.
But in practice this is not what people want and so this change iterates over properties
in the order they are returned by Object.keys(obj), which is almost always the order
in which the properties were defined.

Sometimes is not desirable to use interpolation on attributes because
the user agent parses them before the interpolation takes place. I.e:

<svg>
  <circle cx=""{{cx}}"" cy=""{{cy}}"" r=""{{r}}""></circle>
</svg>

The snippet throws three browser errors, one for each attribute.

For some attributes, AngularJS fixes that behaviour introducing special
directives like ng-href or ng-src.

This commit is a more general solution that allows prefixing any
attribute with ""ng-attr-"", ""ng:attr:"" or ""ng_attr_""  so it will
be set only when the binding is done. The prefix is then removed.

Example usage:

<svg>
  <circle ng-attr-cx=""{{cx}}"" ng-attr-cy=""{{cy}}"" ng:attr-r=""{{r}}""></circle>
</svg>

document.getElementById will no longer be available.

The priming functions are going to come in handy when we create new DOM
fragments in mountComponent.

For backwards compatibility, the ReactDOMNodeCache and getDOMNodeID
modules still exist, but they are implemented entirely in terms of

Probably due to implementation differences in browsers for pre-DST period (see
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5017 and especially
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5017#issuecomment-90775226 for context), some
`TzDate` tests had different behavior on different Timezones/Regions (e.g. failed in Australia,
which started to observe DST in 1971).
Since the used year (`1970`) didn't have any particular significance, this commit fixes the issue
by using a year that is more consistently handled by browsers (`2000`).

ReactDOMInput and a few other classes handle change event by scheduling updateWrapper() in an asap().
It gets executed after the batch, which confuses ReactPerf that expects all DOM writes to happen during a batch.
Since this implementation of ReactPerf relying on the stack is going away, let's plug the hole temporarily by ignoring DOM writes that occur during postponed updateWrapper(). In any case, they have no relation to actual calculations of wasted renders, as they don't occur due to updateComponent(), but rather due to onChange() special DOM behavior.

The new API on `$cookies` includes:

 * `get`
 * `put`
 * `getObject`
 * `putObject`
 * `getAll`
 * `remove`

The new API no longer polls the browser for changes to the cookies and no longer copy
cookie values onto the `$cookies` object.

The polling is expensive and caused issues with the `$cookies` properties not
synchronizing correctly with the actual browser cookie values.

The reason the polling was originally added was to allow communication between
different tabs, but there are better ways to do this today (for example `localStorage`).

DEPRECATION NOTICE:

`$cookieStore` is now deprecated as all the useful logic
has been moved to `$cookies`, to which `$cookieStore` now simply
delegates calls.

BREAKING CHANGE:

`$cookies` no longer exposes properties that represent the current browser cookie
values. Now you must explicitly the methods described above to access the cookie
values. This also means that you can no longer watch the `$cookies` properties for
changes to the browser's cookies.

This feature is generally only needed if a 3rd party library was programmatically
changing the cookies at runtime. If you rely on this then you must either write code that
can react to the 3rd party library making the changes to cookies or implement your own polling
mechanism.

This triggers a warning if you try to pass a keyed object as a child.

You now have to wrap it in React.addons.createFragment(object) which
creates a proxy (in dev) which warns if it is accessed. The purpose of
this is to make these into opaque objects so that nobody relies on its
data structure.

After that we can turn it into a different data structure such as a
ReactFragment node or an iterable of flattened ReactElements.

In some scenarios you want to be able to specify properties on the event
that is passed to the event handler. JQuery does this by overloading the
first parameter (`eventName`). If it is an object with a `type` property
then we assume that it must be a custom event.

In this case the custom event must provide the `type` property which is
the name of the event to be triggered.  `triggerHandler` will continue to
provide dummy default functions for `preventDefault()`, `isDefaultPrevented()`
and `stopPropagation()` but you may override these with your own versions
in your custom object if you wish.

In addition the commit provides some performance and memory usage
improvements by only creating objects and doing work that is necessary.

This commit also renames the parameters inline with jQuery.

The default CSS driver in ngAnimate directly uses node.className when reading
the CSS class string on the given element. While this works fine with standard
HTML DOM elements, SVG elements have their own DOM property. By switching to use
node.getAttribute, ngAnimate can extract the element's className value without
throwing an exception.

When using jQuery over jqLite, ngAnimate will not properly handle SVG elements
for an animation. This is because jQuery doesn't process SVG elements within it's
DOM operation code by default. To get this to work, simply include the jquery.svg.js
JavaScript file into your application.

BREAKING CHANGE (since 1.2.0 and 1.3.0-beta.1):

Angular now requires a `<base>` tag when html5 mode of `$location` is enabled. Reasoning:
Using html5 mode without a `<base href=""..."">` tag makes relative links for images, links, ...
relative to the current url if the browser supports
the history API. However, if the browser does not support the history API Angular falls back to using the `#`,
and then all those relative links would be broken.

The `<base>` tag is also needed when a deep url is loaded from the server, e.g. `http://server/some/page/url`.
In that case, Angular needs to decide which part of the url is the base of the application, and which part
is path inside of the application.

To summarize: Now all relative links are always relative to the `<base>` tag.

Exception (also a breaking change):
Link tags whose `href` attribute starts with a `#` will only change the hash of the url, but nothing else
(e.g. `<a href=""#someAnchor"">`). This is to make it easy to scroll to anchors inside a document.

Related to #6162
Closes #8492

BREAKING CHANGE (since 1.2.17 and 1.3.0-beta.10):

In html5 mode without a `<base>` tag on older browser that don't support the history API
relative paths were adding up. E.g. clicking on `<a href=""page1"">` and then on `<a href=""page2"">`
would produce `$location.path()==='/page1/page2'. The code that introduced this behavior was removed
and Angular now also requires a `<base>` tag to be present when using html5 mode.

In ES262, there are two properties which are used to get a primitive value from an Object:

- valueOf() -- a method which returns a primitive value represented by the Object
- toString() -- a method which returns a string value representing the Object.

When comparing objects using relational operators, the abstract operation ToPrimitive(O, TypeHint) is used,
which will use these methods to retrieve a value.

This CL emulates the behaviour of ToPrimitive(), and ensures that no ordering occurs if the retrieved value
is identical.

This behaviour was previously used for Date objects, however it can be safely made generic as it applies to
all objects.

An earlier commit dc149de9364c66b988f169f67cad39577ba43434 caused an error where the first option of
a select would be skipped over if it had a blank disabled value. These tests demonstrate that with
that commit in place, blank disabled options are skipped in a select. When the commit is reverted,
the correct behavior is seen that the blank disabled option is still selected in both selects
marked with required and those that have optional choices.

Makes the time zone optional in the date filter

Problem with the current R_ISO8601_STR regex was that the time was optional, but the zone was not.
This results in the filter not formatting local date times, which it could easily do.

For example:
2012-08-30 -> formatted
2012-08-30T06:06:06.123Z -> formatted
2012-08-30T06:06:06.123 -> NOT formatted

A simple change in the regex fixes this. Arguably this is closer to the ISO8601 spec which specifies
local dates being in the ""current time zone"" and not requiring a Z. In any case it behaves more like
a user would expect.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Before this change, the filter assumed that the input (if not undefined/null) was of type 'string'
and that certain methods (such as `.match()`) would be available on it. Passing a non-string value
would most likely result in a not-very-useful error being thrown (trying to call a method that does
not exist) or in unexpected behavior (if the input happened to have the assumed methods).

After this change, a proper (informative) error will be thrown. If you want to pass non-string
values through `linky`, you need to explicitly convert them to strings first.
Since input values could be initialized asynchronously, `undefined` or `null` will still be
returned unchanged (without throwing an error).

Previously only repeated `/` delimiters were collapsed into a
single `/`.  Now, the sequence `/.` at the end of the template, i.e.
only followed by a sequence of word characters, is collapsed into a single
`.`. This makes it easier to support suffixes on resource URLs.
For example, given a resource template of `/some/path/:id.:format`, if
the `:id` is `""""` but format `""json""` then the URL is now
`/some/path.json`, rather than `/some/path/.json`.

BREAKING CHANGE: A `/` followed by a `.`, in the last segment of the
URL template is now collapsed into a single `.` delimiter. For example:
`users/.json` will become `users.json`. If your server relied upon this
sequence then it will no longer work. In this case you can now escape the
`/.` sequence with `/\.`

A node is considered valid if it

  1. has the expected ID (more of a sanity check than something that is
     ever likely to go wrong), and

  2. is contained by a currently mounted container.

When these requirements are met, we can be confident that
`ReactMount.findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow(node.id) === node`, which is
important for cache consistency because `findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow` is
what we fall back to when we don't find a node in the cache.

Point 2 is a subtle requirement, because it allows nodes to be valid even
if they are not currently contained by a document. Rendering into a
detached node is okay, in other words (which is something that
`document.getElementById` never properly accounted for).

Containment testing takes linear time in the depth of the DOM, which
sounds unfortunate until you realize that virtually all browsers support a
native `ancestor.contains(descendant)` method, and in practice the vast
majority of nodes are either orphaned with `.parentNode === null` or not
very deep relative to their container.

In commit 6820322db562382fac903be35831275948825317 of Karma-Jasmine, the
dependency on angular.dump was removed. This caused two undesirable side
effects in the angular.js project. 1) Tests for presence of mock dump were failing,
and 2) the default window.dump was not outputting valuable angular-aware info. This
simple fix adds window.dump in testabilityPatch, to preprocess dumped input prior

There are certain cases where you can end up with a collision with an implicit
key (array index) if your explicit key prop is a number. They should use
different namespaces. Therefore I wrap explicit keys in curlies and implicit
array indices in brackets.

I added a simple test case, but another case came up on the mailing list. Where
undefined entries in an array actually results in an entry and therefore an
implicit key.

This got missed in the doc migration: When there is an error in an
Angular app, extra information is placed in the URL, which can be used
by the docs application to display a more useful message.

This fix adds that back in.  The error message templates are extracted
by the minerr tool during build and put into the errors.json file. The
errors-doc processor will load this up and attach these message templates
to the error docs.

The display of these templates was already in place, via the errorDisplay
directive in docs/app/js/errors.js.

(Also, moved the error.template.html file into the angular.js repository
from the dgeni-packages repository as this is specific to the angular.js
project and all the other error related stuff is in here.

Finally, also, added an e2e test that checks that minerr formatted
messages are displayed correctly.

* Don't count the time inside flushes towards lifecycle hooks

Fixes #6842.

We keep the existing behavior of testing for matching `onBeginLifeCycleTimer`/`onEndLifeCycleTimer` calls, but we push the current timer onto the stack if we enter a flush.
This solves an issue with portals which cause updates while a lifecycle timer is already running.

I chose to subtract the time spent in the flush from the time counted towards the lifecycle method because it would artificially inflate the “total” time of the component due to all the components inside the portal, so it would skew the exclusive table.

* Fix up the comment

Thanks @acdlite. Add comment about future unit test coverage.

This was actually hiding the fact that we are only able to reuse
existing work if it was marked as completely finished which it
won't be if we reuse its pending priority.

However, we should be able to bail out even if there is work
remaining in a subtree.

It is essential that users of `$interval` destroy the interval when they are finished.
Otherwise you can get memory leaks.
Often `$intervals` are used in directives or controllers and developers don't think
about what happens when the component is destroyed.
If a directive/controller scope is destroyed, then the $interval should be destroyed as well.
This could cause some issues with developers who assume that the interval will be cleared
for them when the scope is destroyed.

I believe that the library could/should handle this as well, but thats another issue.

In order to make the behavior compatible with $rootScope.$watch and $rootScope.$on methods, and
make it possible to deregister an attribute observer, Attributes.$observe method now returns a
deregistration function instead of the observer itself.

BREAKING CHANGE: calling attr.$observe no longer returns the observer function, but a
    deregistration function instead.

    To migrate the code follow the example below:

    Before:

```
    directive('directiveName', function() {
      return {
        link: function(scope, elm, attr) {
          var observer = attr.$observe('someAttr', function(value) {
            console.log(value);
          });
        }
      };
    });
```

    After:

```
    directive('directiveName', function() {
      return {
        link: function(scope, elm, attr) {
          var observer = function(value) {
            console.log(value);
          };

          attr.$observe('someAttr', observer);
        }
      };
    });

Fixes a regression in ngAnimate introduced in 2f4437b3, whereby SVG elements would not be able to
have classes removed by ngAnimate methods when jQuery was loaded (without also including libraries
which patch jQuery to support SVG elements, such as jquery-svgdom.js).

This fix exports jqLiteHasClass as a private method `$$hasClass` on the `angular` global object,
which enables ngAnimate to use this SVG-safe method for testing if the class is available.

With this commit, ngModel will now handle parsing first and then validation
afterwards once the parsing is successful. If any parser along the way returns
`undefined` then ngModel will break the chain of parsing and register a
a parser error represented by the type of input that is being collected
(e.g. number, date, datetime, url, etc...). If a parser fails for a standard
text input field then an error of `parse` will be placed on `model.$error`.

BREAKING CHANGE

Any parser code from before that returned an `undefined` value
(or nothing at all) will now cause a parser failure. When this occurs
none of the validators present in `$validators` will run until the parser
error is gone.

React's top-level event delegation dispatches `AbstractEvent` objects that contain:

 - `nativeEvent`, the original browser event.
 - `data`, an object with custom normalized properties.

This diff creates a set of `DelegateEvent` classes that will replace `AbstractEvent`. The goal is two-fold:

 # Provide a cross-browser implementation that conforms to the DOM Level 3 Events API so people don't have to use `nativeEvent`.
 # Generalize the event object API so that it can be shared by `DOMEventManager`, a top-level event delegation WIP.

If jQuery was used with Angular the touch logic was looking for touches
under the original event object. However, jQuery wraps all events, keeping
the original one under the originalEvent property and copies/normalizes some
of event properties. Not all properties are copied, e.g. touches which caused
them to not be recognized properly.

a keyframe style can solely be applied to an animation triggered with

    - inject method can return, instance, or call function which have $inject
      property
    - initialize services with $creation=[eager|eager-publish] this means that
      only some of the services are now globally accessible
  - upgraded $become on scope to use injector hence respect the $inject property

    parent, api, behavior and instance this should speed up execution since
    scope will now create one __proto__ chain per scope (not three).

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY WARNING:
  - services now need to have $inject instead of inject property for proper
    injection this breaks backward compatibility
  - not all services are now published into root scope
    (only: $location, $cookie, $window)
  - if you have widget/directive which uses services on scope

@spicyj

I think completely removing warnAndMonitorForKeyUse is a bit difficult, without
duplicating a ton of code. This at least ensures that the format string passed
to `warning` is unique. Plus, because the FB internal code in question only
matches the beginning of the format string, I think there should be zero
internal changes that need to be made to support this refactor.

implementation of a polyfill for Symbol. Thus, removing I will keep the
more popular polyfill (core-js) and remove the buggy polyfill
(es6-symbol).

If you are reading this and can think of a confounding factor that is
causing this bug, please let me know and we can try to work together to
add support for medikoo/es6-symbol.

I had to extract `bower` task out of the package, because we need to run `bower install` before building and `grunt bower` can fail, which takes down the whole process and therefore it wouldn't build.

Often it is impossible to set the http defaults during the config phase,
because the config info is not available at this time.

A good example is authentication - often the app needs to bootstrap,
allow user to enter credentials and only then it gains access to
session token which then should be sent to the server with every request.
Without having the ability to set the defaults at runtime, the developer
either has to resort to hacks, or has to set the session token header
with every request made by the app.

This way it doesn't end when some random element elsewhere on the page has an ending transition.

It must be noted that this is not a complete fix. If you have multiple transitions on the element, it still ends when the first ends.

I ran into this not working (the transition ends almost immediately, because some unrelated transition ends). This fixes it for me, but I was wondering whether this cornercase was considered, and whether the other cornercase (multiple transitions) was considered.

I think it's very hard to get this correct, and think it might be better to make the timeout explicit, or at least allow to set it explicit, and fall back to this behaviour. But I'm really interested in feedback on this one."

If an element contains two ""element"" transcludes then the initial clone
consists of only comment nodes.  The concern was that this meant that
the transclude scopes would not be cleaned up.

But it turns out that in the case that there are only comments then the
scope is never attached to anything so we don't need to worry about cleaning
it up.

Later if a concrete element is created as part of the transclude then these
elements will have destroy handlers.

is a signed of a programming error.

This introduces <ReactTransitionGroup>, a component that works a lot
like Angular's ng-animate.

The problem we're currently facing is twofold:
1. We don't really have a great convention surrounding CSS transitions
   in React
2. (harder) we can't animate nodes that are leaving the DOM, as their
   nodes are instantly destroyed.

To solve the first issue I've adopted Angular's convention. It's
implemented in ReactTransitionableChild.

The second part is what's tricky. To do this I've implemented three modules:
- ReactTransitionableChild, which can keep its old children around if they
  change to null
- ReactTransitionKeySet, which can look at a prev and next set of child
  keys and merge them in a reasonable way
- ReactTransitionGroup, which combines ReactTransitionableChild and
  ReactTransitionKeySet to keep nodes that are leaving the DOM in the
  DOM until their animations are complete

Summary:

I had to cast into any because flow doesn't think that checking the lowercase version of nodeName is a valid way to refine the variable from HTMLElement to HTMLInputElement. I'm also not confident enough in changing the implementation to an instanceof HTMLInputElement to please flow. It also takes care of the null check in the process.

The `nodeName &&` condition wasn't useful since the two branches are checking it against concrete values and actually makes the type different since nodeName is not a boolean per se. I replaced them with if conditions to make it clearer what it actually did instead of doing boolean logic tricks.

It is unclear why I had to type supportedInputTypes, see this internal post for a discussion: https://www.facebook.com/groups/flowtype/permalink/1084168611631753/

The only difference in behavior is that I now explicitely convert to boolean the object dereference via `!!`.

Test Plan:
npm run flow
Careful inspection of the code

CSP spec got changed and it is no longer possible to autodetect if a policy is
active without triggering a CSP error:

https://github.com/w3c/webappsec/commit/18882953ce2d8afca25f685557fef0e0471b2c9a

Now we use `new Function('')` to detect if CSP is on. To prevent error from this
detection to show up in console developers have to use the ngCsp directive.

(This problem became more severe after our recent removal of `simpleGetterFn`
 which made us depend on function constructor for all expressions.)

During it's linking phase, `ngView` relies on the info provided in `$route.current` for
instantiating the initial view. `$route.current` is set in the callback of a listener to
`$locationChangeSuccess`, which is registered during the instantiation of the `$route` service.

Thus, it is crucial that the `$route` service is instantiated before the initial
`$locationChangeSuccess` is fired. Since `ngView` declares `$route` as a dependency, the service is
instantiated in time if `ngView` is present during the initial load of the page.

Yet, in cases where `ngView` is included in a template that is loaded asynchronously (e.g. in
another directive's template), the directive factory might not be called soon enough for `$route`
to be instantiated before the initial `$locationChangeSuccess` event is fired.

This commit fixes it, by always instantiating `$route` up front, during the initialization phase.

CSP (content security policy) forbids apps to use eval or
Function(string) generated functions (among other things). For us to be
compatible, we just need to implement the ""getterFn"" in $parse without
violating any of these restrictions.

We currently use Function(string) generated functions as a speed
optimization. With this change, it will be possible to opt into the CSP
compatible mode using the ngCsp directive. When this mode is on Angular
will evaluate all expressions up to 30% slower than in non-CSP mode, but
no security violations will be raised.

In order to use this feature put ngCsp directive on the root element of
the application. For example:

<!doctype html>
<html ng-app ng-csp>
  ...
  ...
</html>

For simple expressions without filters that have a stateless interceptor
then handle the 2nd phase parse evaluation using `inputs`.

TL;DR
This fixes the issue that interpolated simple expressions were evaluated twice
within one digest loop.

Long version, things happen in the following order:

* There was an overhaul on $interpolate, this overhaul changed $parse and
  incorporated the concept of an interceptor.
* Optimization on $parse landed  so expressions that have filters without
  parameters (or the parameters are constants) would be evaluated in 2 phases,
  first to evaluate the expression sans the filter evaluation and then with
  the filter evaluation. This also used interceptors [the second evaluation
  issue was added here]
* More optimizations on $parse landed and now expressions could be evaluated
  in 2 phases. One to get all the possible values that could change (lets call
  this state), the state was checked by $watch to know if an expression changed.
  The second to continue the evaluation (as long as this state is provided).
  This, once again, used interceptors

The last change, was supposed to fix the issue, but there was an assumption in
the existing code that the code would always generate the 2 phases functions,
but that is not true. If the expression is simple enough (just like the one in
your case) then the 2-phase evaluations functions are not generated. In this
case, if a stateless interceptor was added (just like what $interpolate adds)
then the state was not used and you see the function being evaluated twice.
This explains why, if you change the expression from
`Hello {{log('A')}} {{log('B')}}!` to `Hello {{log('A') + ' ' + log('B')}}!`,
then the repetition is not there.

If a JS animation is run before a CSS animation then the JS animation may end up writing style
data to the element. If any transition or animation style data is written then it may end up
being accidentally inherited into the CSS animation hanlder that ngAnimate uses. This may result
in an unexpected outcome due to the tweaks and hacks that the CSS handler places on the element.
If the CSS animation is run before the JS animation then, if there are no transitions on the style
attribute nor within the global CSS on the page then nothing will happen and the JS animation can
work as expected.

While directives are not allowed to request both a new (normal) and an
isolate scope on the same element, the relevant check was not performed
correctly when the directive requesting the isolate scope had a lower
priority and specified a `templateUrl`.
In that case, the check was deferred until the template was fetched, but
the info about other directives requesting a new (normal) scope was not
properly preserved (in `previousCompileContext`).

This commit fixes this, so now an error is thrown (as expected).

If your data contains falsy values for option groups, then these options

contains falsy values that should not be used as groups then you must

Fixes #11716

BREAKING CHANGE:

`ngBind` now uses the same logic as $interpolate (i.e. {{myString}}) when
binding, which means values other than strings are now transformed as following:
- null / undefined become empty string
- with an object's custom toString() function, except if the object is a Date, Array, or Number
- otherwise with JSON.stringify

Previously, ngBind would use always use toString().

The following examples show the different output:
```js
$scope.myPlainObject = {a: 1, b: 2};
$scope.myCustomObject = {a: 1, b: 2, toString: function() {return 'a+b';}};
```

Plain Object:
```html
<!-- Before: -->
<span ng-bind=""myPlainObject"">[object Object]</span>

<!-- After: -->
<span ng-bind=""myPlainObject"">{""a"":1,""b"":2}</span>
```

Object with custom toString():

```html
<!-- Before: -->
<span ng-bind=""myCustomObject"">[object Object]</span>

<!-- After: -->
<span ng-bind=""myCustomObject"">a+b</span>
```

If you want the output of `toString()`, you can use it directly on the value in ngBind:

```html
<span ng-bind=""myObject.toString()"">[object Object]</span>
```

Previously, the extract-components script would create the same number of layers of composites as the page it captures, but it would output a new class for each time any composite is used (since we don't want to replicate all the component logic).

I changed the script to output a single type for each type in the input -- and each generated component takes an index for which output it should return. This should be closer to how the original code behaves, especially with respect to VM function call lookups where the amount of polymorphism makes a difference.

I re-recorded the benchmarks with the new scripts. They run significantly faster:

```
Comparing old.txt (control) vs new.txt (test)
Significant differences marked by ***
% change from control to test, with 99% CIs:

* ssr_pe_cold_ms_jsc_jit
    % change: -41.73% [-43.37%, -40.09%]  ***
    means: 39.3191 (control), 22.9127 (test)
* ssr_pe_cold_ms_jsc_nojit
    % change: -44.24% [-46.69%, -41.80%]  ***
    means: 45.8646 (control), 25.5764 (test)
* ssr_pe_cold_ms_node
    % change: -45.61% [-47.38%, -43.85%]  ***
    means: 90.1118 (control), 49.0116 (test)
```

This is probably in part due to the changes here, but also the page I captured has changed somewhat in the meantime and there seem to be slightly fewer components in the hierarchy, so they're not really comparable. But going forward we can use this benchmark which should be more accurate. I also included an identical copy that uses stateless functional components so we can test optimizations to those later."

and instantiates the controller all for a route that should have been redirected.

A common use case for assigning a function to the redirectTo is to validation authentication,
permission check, or some other logic to determine if the route should continue or redirect
else where. In the end, this happens, but in between, unexpected results may occur by updating
the view and instantiating controllers for logic that wasn't expected to be executed.

http://plnkr.co/edit/8QlA0ouuePH3p35Ntmjy?p=preview

This commit checks for a url change after a potential redirect, it the url changed, and is
not `null` nor `undefined`, exit out and don't process current route change.

Closes #3332
Closes #14658

BREAKING CHANGE

The $route service no longer instantiates controllers nor calls resolves or template functions
for routes that have a `redirectTo` unless the `redirectTo` is a function that returns
`undefined`.

This change causes a new $digest to be scheduled in the next tick if
a task was was sent to the $evalAsync queue from outside of a $digest
or an $apply.

While this mode of operation is not common for most of the user code,
this change means that $q promises that utilze $evalAsync queue to
guarantee asynchronicity of promise apis will now also resolve outside
of a $digest, which turned out to be a big pain point for some developers.

The implementation ensures that we don't do more work than needed and
that we coalese as much work as possible into a single $digest.

The use of $browser instead of setTimeout ensures that we can mock out
and control the scheduling of ""auto-flush"", which should in theory
allow all of the existing code and tests to work without negative
side-effects.

Depends on #1758.

Fixes #1698.

Previously, controlled components would update too soon when using something like ReactLayeredComponentMixin (i.e., before the layer's updates could propagate from the parent), causing the cursor to jump even when always updating the new model value to match the DOM state. With this change, we defer the update until after all nested updates have had a chance to finish, which prevents the cursor from misbehaving.

Also cleaned up the logic around updating a bit -- the .value and .checked updates in ReactDOMInput weren't being relied on at all so I removed them and opted for a simple forceUpdate instead. I also got rid of _isChanging which hasn't been necessary since the introduction of update batching.

Test Plan: Tested the example in http://jsfiddle.net/Bobris/ZZtXn/2/ and verified that the cursor didn't jump. Changed the code to filter out numbers and verified that the field prevents typing numbers (attempting to do so still causes the cursor to jump to the end). Also verified that controlled and uncontrolled radio buttons, textareas, and select boxes work.

This change tweaks the number formatting logic so that an exponential

easier, so we can do a fast check for change without having to
calculate char offsets for selection start and end.

paths where the first segment would be the volume name,
such as ""/C:/mypath"". See #4942 and #4928

However, the solution was specific to the $location non-
HTML5 mode, and was implemented at a lower level of
abstraction than it should have been. This refactor moves
the fix to inside of the LocationHashBangUrl $$parse method.

Currently we're mutating _key. Mutation here is fine, but it needs to
be idempotent - which it's not. This is causing some issues.

Instead I reassign the _key every time it passes through a flattening.
This means that it's unique and stable for a single pass through a composite
component. When it's repassed another level, it loses it previous
identity and is rekeyed by it's new location.

For auto-generated keys by index, this actually means it has the same
semantics as before flattening.

For explicit keys, it has the effect that keys need to be unique at
every level. Regardless of how the key got there. Every component needs to ensure
that it doesn't combine keys from two different sources that may collide. This
is also inline with the old semantics but less intuitive in the new model.

`$sanitize` now uses the same mechanism as `$compile` to validate uris.
By this, the validation in `$sanitize` is more general and can be

Changes
- Creates the new private service `$$sanitizeUri`.
- Moves related specs from `compileSpec.js` into `sanitizeUriSpec.js`.
- Refactors the `linky` filter to be less dependent on `$sanitize`
  internal functions.

Fixes #3748.

This delegates setting the control's parentForm to the parentForm's
$addControl method. This way, the model controller saves one instance
of looking up the parentForm controller. The form controller keeps two
lookups (one for its own ctrl, one for the optional parent).

This also fixes adding the parentForm in the following case:
- a control is removed from a parent, but its corresponding DOM
element is not destroyed
- the control is then re-added to the form

Before the fix, the control's parentForm was only set once during
controller initialization, so the the parentForm would not be set on
the control in that specific case.

This prevents PhantomJS tests from hanging in the open-source React repo.

Until the advent of `""use strict""`, passing `null` as the context object

global object inside the invoked function.

Technically the `""use strict""` directive is supposed to make it possible
that `this === null`, but strict mode is not respected by all browsers,
including (unfortunately) PhantomJS.

Since these `expect`-ations are just testing binding behavior, let's not
make them also test strict mode `this` handling.

Breaking changes

- key/ref are no longer accessible on props but they are accessible on the
  descriptors. This means that parents/owners can access it but not the
  component itself.

- Descriptor factories are now plain functions and you can't rely on the
  prototype or constructors of descriptors to identify the component type.

Existing descriptor factories are now wrapped in a legacy factory. Currently it
does nothing but it will give us a hook to track callers to factories that are
not using JSX but just invoking the function directly. It also proxies static
methods/properties to the underlying class. The newer factories don't have this
feature.

ReactTextComponent has it's own little factory because it's props is not an
object. This is a detail and will go away once ReactTextComponent no longer
needs descriptors.

Background:
Prior to ffb6b2f, there was a bug in `URL_REGEXP`, trying to match the hostname as `\S+` (meaning
any non-space character). This resulted in never actually validating the structure of the URL (e.g.
segments such as port, path, query, fragment).
Then ffb6b2f and subsequently e4bb838 fixed that bug, but revealed `URL_REGEXP`'s ""strictness"" wrt
certain parts of the URL.

Since browsers are too lenient when it comes to URL validation anyway, it doesn't make sense for
Angular to be much stricter, so this commit relaxes the ""strictness"" of `URL_REGEXP`, focusing more
on the general structure, than on the specific characters allowed in each segment.

Note 1: `URL_REGEXP` still seems to be stricter than browsers in some cases.
Note 2: Browsers don't always agree on what is a valid URL and what isn't.

* Cut out isomorphic dependencies from the renderers

These files reaches into isomorphic files.

The ReactElement functions are exposed on the React object anyway
so I can just use those instead.

I also found some files that are not shared that should be in
renderers shared.

* Found a few more shared dependencies

renderSubtreeIntoContainer is only used by the DOM renderer.
It's not an addon.

ReactClass isn't needed as a dependency since injection doesn't
happen anymore.

* Use a shim file to load addons' dependencies on DOM

By replacing this intermediate file we can do the lazy loading
without needing any lazy requires. This set up works with ES
modules.

We could also replace the globalShim thing with aliased files
instead for consistency.

* Bundle DOM renderers into their individual UMD bundles

Instead of exposing the entire DOM renderer on the react.js
package, I only expose CurrentOwner and ComponentTreeDevtool which
are currently the only two modules that share __state__ with the
renderers.

Then I package each renderer in its own package. That could allow
us to drop more server dependencies from the client package. It
will also allow us to ship fiber as a separate renderer.

The total size for react.min.js + react-dom.min.js is +19kb larger
because of the overlap between them right now. I'd like to see
what an optimizing compiler can do to this. Some of that is fbjs
stuff. There shouldn't need to be that much overlap so that's
something we can hunt. We should keep isomorphic absolutely
minimal so there's no reason for other React clones not to use it.
There will be less overlap with Fiber.

However, another strategy that we could do is package the
isomorphic package into each renderer bundle and conditionally
initialize it if it hasn't already been initialized. That way
you only pay an overlap tax when there are two renderers on the
page but not without it. It's also easier to just pull in one
package. The downside is the versioning stuff that the separate
npm package would solve. That applies to CDNs as well.

ReactWithAddons is a bit weird because it is packaged into the
isomorphic package but has a bunch of DOM dependencies. So we have
to load them lazily since the DOM package gets initialized after.

Currently, `ReactUpdates` updates dirty components in increasing order of mount depth. However, mount depth is only relative to the component passed into `React.render`. This breaks down for components that invoke `React.render` as an implementation detail because the child components will be updated before the parent component.

This fixes the problem by using the order in which components are mounted (instead of their depth). The mount order transcends component trees (rooted at `React.render` calls).

Turns out lots of people write invalid HTML all the time and no one, including your browser or React, cares. Most invalid HTML combinations don't cause magic reparented nodes; only some do. The HTML5 parsing spec (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html) specifies which tag combinations cause strange parsing behavior. I did my best to encode the logic here. It's more lenient than before in some cases, but more strict in others (before we didn't look at the whole stack of tags; now we warn with deeply nested `p` or `form` or `a` tags).

My last strategy of getting each node recursively while unmounting was a pain to make work properly with ReactMount's confusing cache. Now, we get the node before unmounting anything in the subtree (and we don't try to find the nodes of descendants).

This is a temporary solution and can go away when we get rid of the giant ReactMount node hash map.

The quotes rule had to be disabled for e2e tests generated from ngdoc
because dgeni templates use double quotes as string delimiters.

Since we can't have guarantees that dgeni template wrappers will follow
the same JS code style the Angular 1 repo uses, we should find a way
to enforce our ESLint setup only for the parts in this repo, perhaps
via prepending a generated `/* eslint-enable OUR_RULES */` pragma.

Pull request #526 updated the behavior of vendor/constants.js without
changing any source files or the bin/jsx-internal script, so files that
should have been rebuilt (like utils/__tests__/ImmutableObject-test.js)
were not automatically rebuilt (unless you knew to do `grunt clean` or
`rm -rf .module-cache` manually).

This commit allows us to bump a version number when we know the transform
toolchain has been altered in a way that will not be visible to
commoner/jsx.

With this convention, if we reset to an older revision (e.g. during a git
bisect) and the appropriate cached module files are still in the
.module-cache/, they can be used without rebuilding. That's why I prefer
this approach to just deleting the .module-cache/.

With the exception of simple demos, it is not helpful to use globals
for controller constructors. This adds a new method to `$controllerProvider`
to re-enable the old behavior, but disables this feature by default.

BREAKING CHANGE:
`$controller` will no longer look for controllers on `window`.
The old behavior of looking on `window` for controllers was originally intended
for use in examples, demos, and toy apps. We found that allowing global controller
functions encouraged poor practices, so we resolved to disable this behavior by
default.

To migrate, register your controllers with modules rather than exposing them
as globals:

Before:

```javascript
function MyController() {
  // ...
}
```

After:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', []).controller('MyController', [function() {
  // ...
}]);
```

Although it's not recommended, you can re-enable the old behavior like this:

```javascript
angular.module('myModule').config(['$controllerProvider', function($controllerProvider) {
  // this option might be handy for migrating old apps, but please don't use it
  // in new ones!
  $controllerProvider.allowGlobals();
}]);
```

Beforehand it was impossible to issue an animation via $animate on an
element that is outside the realm of an Angular app. Take for example a
dropdown menu where the menu is positioned with absolute positioning...
The element will most likely need to be placed by the `<body>` tag, but
if the angular application is bootstrapped elsewhere then it cannot be
animated.

This fix provides support for `$animate.pin()` which allows for an
external element to be virtually placed in the DOM structure of a host
parent element within the DOM of an angular app.

When option elements use ngValue, value or interpolated text to set
the option value, i.e. when the parent select doesn't have an ngModel,
there is no necessity in registering the options with the select controller.

The registration was usually not a problem, as the ngModelController is set to a noop controller,
so that all further interactions are aborted ($render etc)

However, since f02b707 ngValue sets a hashed value inside the option value
(to support arbitrary value types). This can cause issues with tests that expect unhashed values.
The issue was found in angular-material, which uses select + ngValue to populate mdSelect.

POSSIBLE BREAKING CHANGE:

Option elements will no longer set their value attribute from their text value when their select
element has no ngModel associated. Setting the value is only needed for the select directive to
match model values and options. If no ngModel is present, the select directive doesn't need it.

This should not affect many applications as the behavior was undocumented and not part of a public
API. It also has no effect on the usual HTML5 behavior that sets the select value to the option text
if the option does not provide a value attribute.

After #11124 got merged, a security vulnerability got introduced.
Animation in SVG became tolerated by the sanitizer.

Exploit Example:
```
<svg>
  <a xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""?"">
    <circle r=""400""></circle>
    <animate attributeName=""xlink:href"" begin=""0"" from=""javascript:alert(1)"" to=""&"" />
  </a>
</svg>
```

Here we are animating an anchor's href, starting from a value that's a javascript URI,
allowing the executing of arbitrary javascript in the process.

Preventing only the animation of links is tricky, as SVG is weird and namespaces aren't predictable.
We've decided to have the sanitizer filter out svg animation tags instead.

Considering the sanitizer is commonly used to sanitize untrusted HTML code, this shouldn't affect
many apps in the wild. Also, no release has been with #11124 in it, but not this fix.

""appear"" differs from ""enter"" in that all children of a transition group at mount time will ""appear"" but will not ""enter"". All children later added to an existing transition group will ""enter"" but not ""appear"".

This extra transition phase allows for animation-on-mount effects.

A mirroring ""appear"" prop has been added to ReactCSSTransitionGroup, however for reverse-compatibility (and because ""appear"" is less common) it defaults to false.

always block the transition from starting (via `transition: 0s none`)

block was removed as soon as the pending class was added. This fix
allows for styles to be applied in the pending class without causing

8bfeddb5d671017f4a21b8b46334ac816710b143 added changes to make relational operator work as it
normally would in JS --- unfortunately, this broke due to my failure to account for typeof null
being ""object"".

This refactoring attempts to convert object values to primitives still, in a fashion similar to
the SortCompare (and subsequently the ToString() algorithm) from ES, in order to account for `null`
and also simplify code to some degree.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, if either value being compared in the orderBy comparator was null or undefined, the
order would not change. Now, this order behaves more like Array.prototype.sort, which by default
pushes `null` behind objects, due to `n` occurring after `[` (the first characters of their
stringified forms) in ASCII / Unicode. If `toString` is customized, or does not exist, the
behaviour is undefined.

This allows developers to use white-space in their attributes, for example as value for
input[type=radio], as a separator in ngList, or as a value in any custom directive binding.
It's also consistent with the HTML spec, which allows white-space in attributes, and consistent
with Angular2, which also allows white-space in attributes.

Fixes #5513
Fixes #14539
Closes #5597

BREAKING CHANGE:

White-space in attributes is no longer trimmed automatically. This includes leading and trailing
white-space, and attributes that are purely white-space.

To migrate, attributes that require trimming must now be trimmed manually.

A common cases where stray white-space can cause problems is when
attribute values are compared, for example in an $observer:

Before:
```
$attrs.$observe('myAttr', function(newVal) {
  if (newVal === 'false') ...
});
```

To migrate, the attribute value should be trimmed manually:
```
$attrs.$observe('myAttr', function(newVal) {
  if (newVal.trim() === 'false') ...
});
```

Note that `$parse` trims expressions automatically, so attributes with expressions (e.g. directive
bindings) are unlikely to be affected by stray white-space.

we commonly assign stuff in if statments like this:

if (variable = someFn()) {

}

This results in lint and IDE warnings (did you mean ==?).

It is better to be explicit about our intention and wrap the assignement
into parens:

if ((variable = someFn())) {
  //do something with variable
}

Doing so suppresses warnings + is easier to understand the intention.

I verified that the closure compiler strips the extra parens, so there
is no byte overhead for this safety practice.

We should use this style going forward...

Many thanks to @NevilleS and @jbedard for collaborating with me on a solution to this!

Closes #9394
Closes #9865

BREAKING CHANGE: previously, ngModel invoked getter/setters in the global context.

For example:

```js
<input ng-model=""model.value"" ng-model-options=""{ getterSetter: true }"">
```

would previously invoke `model.value()` in the global context.

Now, ngModel invokes `value` with `model` as the context.

It's unlikely that real apps relied on this behavior. If they did they can use `.bind` to explicilty
bind a getter/getter to the global context, or just reference globals normally without `this`.

The intention of the `npm-react/**/*` rule was to copy recursively but it would have flattened any nested directory structure. I changed the `build/modules` rule to copy recursively as well, which is necessary for `ReactTestUtils` to be able to require `test/mock-modules.js` successfully. (`ReactTestUtils` isn't included in a clean `npm-react` build currently but it will be in the future.)

This also makes running ART tests more practical.

This commit fixes #1261 and #1532. This covers
two separate issues:

- Positive timezones were being formatted without
a leading `+` resulting in a formatting string
like: ""HH:MM:ssZ"" giving ""12:13:141000"" instead
of ""12:13:14+1000"". Fixed by checking if timezone
is > 0 and adding a leading ""+"".

- Timezone output signs were inverted.
mock.TzDate expects the timezone _offset_ as it's
first argument, _not_ the timezone. This means
that a mock.TzDate with a positive offset should
result in a date string with a negative timezone,
and vice-versa.

//before this fix
$animate.addClass(element, 'super');
expect(element).toHaveClass('super');

//now
$animate.addClass(element, 'super');
$rootScope.$digest();
expect(element).toHaveClass('super');
```

$animate will also tally the amount of times classes are added and removed and only animate
the left over classes once the digest kicks in. This means that for any directive code that
adds and removes the same CSS class on the same element then this may result in no animation
being triggered at all.

```js
$animate.addClass(element, 'klass');
$animate.removeClass(element, 'klass');

$rootScope.$digest();

//nothing happens...

disabling the maxlength validation (always returning true) when maxlength

Summary:
Trying to start adding flow types to files in React. I needed to add a script to package.json in order to run flow, flow-bin is already a dependency.

I had to rewrite the implementation a bit. Flow doesn't recognize

```
var currentIsArray = Array.isArray(current);
if (currentIsArray) {
  // not refined
}
```

but the following does work

```
if (Array.isArray(current)) {
  // refined
}
```

Test Plan:
npm run-script flow
npm run-script test accumulate

masks legitimate cases where status 0 should be returned. This commits

If there are no listeners for `onSelect` yet, do not extract events. This way we can avoid issues where listeners have been set up for some event dependencies for `SelectEventPlugin`, but not all.

For instance, if `topMouseDown` has been registered but not `topMouseUp`, event extraction will set the `mouseDown` flag to true but never unset it. This leads to bugs when `onSelect` is registered and should be firing during normal key behavior. Since no `topMouseUp` has yet occurred to unset the flag, `onSelect` fails to fire.

End 2 end tests wait for all `$timeout`s to be run before completing the test.
This was problematic where we were using timeouts that restarted themselves because
there would never be a point when all timeouts had completed, causing the tests to hang.

To fix this $timeout had been monkey-patched but this caused other issue itself.

Now that we have $interval we don't need to use $timeout handlers that re-trigger the $timeout
so we can ditch the monkey-patch.

This commit tidies up any examples that are using this approach and changes them to use $interval
instead.

Fix the following exploit:

The exploit:
• 1. Array.sort takes a comparison function and passes it 2 parameters to compare.
  2. It then calls .valueOf() if the result is not a primitive.
• The Function object conveniently accepts two string arguments so we can use this
  to construct a function.  However, this doesn't do much unless we can execute it.
• We set the valueOf function on Function.prototype to Function.prototype.call.
  This causes the function that we constructed to be executed when sort calls
  .valueOf() on the result of the comparison.

The fix is in two parts.
• Disallow passing unsafe objects to function calls as parameters.
• Do not traverse the Function object when setting a path.

anymore. textContent should be better for more things anyway, as the
original 309a88bcf62c1c64a2b91c0eb753c19209a425b2 indicates. It should be faster because innerText
requires layout.

This also allows us to use strings with newlines in our rendered output
and have confidence that they will render the same on subsequent
re-renders. This is especially useful for es6-style backtick multi-line
strings. This will be more consistent as textContent is supported almost
everwhere so we won't have differing behavior between webkit and
firefox.

non-standard Object.prototype properties such as 'watch' and 'unwatch' in Firefox. Because of
this shadowing, ngClass and ngAnimate were unable to correctly determine the changed status
of these classes.

In orderto accomodate this patch, some changes have been necessary elsewhere in the codebase,
in order to facilitate iterating, comparingand copying objects with a null prototype, or which
shadow the `hasOwnProperty` method

The previous solution for opening Plunkers from the docs relied on tight
coupling between the docs site and the plunkr site, in particular the
URL to the example code on the docs server was hard coded in the Plunker
site.

This change goes back to the old POST method of creating a Plunker, but
with a subtle difference: In the very old docs, the content was injected
directly into the example HTML at build time.  This was easy enough to
do as the example actually ran in the current page but also increased
the size of the doc page.

The new examples are run in completely separate iframes. This new version
of showing a Plunker loads the file content for the Plunker from the
server by accessing the example's manifest.json file using $http requests.

This also has the additional benefit that you can now generate plunkers
from examples that are running locally or, frankly, in any folder on any
server, such as personal builds on the Jenkins CI server.

This lets you use any kind of iterable as a container of react child elements. It also preserves keys when possible if the iterable is keyed.

 * Use an ES6 Map or Set to hold children.
 * Use an Immutable-js collection to hold children.
 * Use a function* which yields children.

Concretely, this removes the necessary conversion to JS objects if you're mapping over Immutable-js collections to get children, i.e.:

```
<div>
  {myImmutable.map(val => <span>{val}</span>).toJS()
</div>
```

Now we can remove the `toJS()` and the intermediate allocation along with it.

This also cleans up the traverseAllChildrenImpl method.

Migrates the Angular project from Rake to Grunt.

Benefits:
- Drops Ruby dependency
- Lowers barrier to entry for contributions from JavaScript ninjas
- Simplifies the Angular project setup and build process
- Adopts industry-standard tools specific to JavaScript projects
- Support building angular.js on Windows platform (really?!? why?!?)

BREAKING CHANGE: Rake is completely replaced by Grunt. Below are the deprecated Rake tasks and their Grunt equivalents:

rake --> grunt
rake package --> grunt package
rake init --> N/A
rake clean --> grunt clean
rake concat_scenario --> grunt build:scenario
rake concat --> grunt build
rake concat_scenario --> grunt build:scenario
rake minify --> grunt minify
rake version --> grunt write:version
rake docs --> grunt docs
rake webserver --> grunt webserver
rake test --> grunt test
rake test:unit --> grunt test:unit
rake test:<jqlite|jquery|modules|e2e> --> grunt test:<jqlite|jquery|modules|end2end|e2e>
rake test[Firefox+Safari] --> grunt test --browsers Firefox,Safari
rake test[Safari] --> grunt test --browsers Safari
rake autotest --> grunt autotest

NOTES:
* For convenience grunt test:e2e starts a webserver for you, while grunt test:end2end doesn't.
  Use grunt test:end2end if you already have the webserver running.
* Removes duplicate entry for Describe.js in the angularScenario section of angularFiles.js
* Updates docs/src/gen-docs.js to use #done intead of the deprecated #end
* Uses grunt-contrib-connect instead of lib/nodeserver (removed)
* Removes nodeserver.sh, travis now uses grunt webserver
* Built and minified files are identical to Rake's output, with the exception of one less
  character for git revisions (using --short) and a couple minor whitespace differences

The `window.location.hash' setter will strip of a single leading hash character
if it exists from the fragment  before joining the fragment value to the href
with a new hash character.

This meant that if we want the fragment to lead with a hash character, we
must do `window.location.hash = '##test'` to ensure that the first hash
character in the fragment is not lost.

The `$location.hash` setter works differently and assumes that the value
passed is the the full fragment, i.e. it does not attempt to strip off a
single leading hash character.

Previously, if you called, `$location.hash('#test')`, the leading hash was
being stripped and the resulting url fragment did not contain this hash:
`$location.hash()`, then became 'test' rather than `#test`, which led to
an infinite digest.

Adds $location state method allowing to get/set a History API state via
pushState & replaceState methods.

Note that:
- Angular treats states undefined and null as the same; trying to change
one to the other without touching the URL won't do anything. This is necessary
to prevent infinite digest loops when setting the URL to itself in IE<10 in
the HTML5 hash fallback mode.
- The state() method is not compatible with browsers not supporting
the HTML5 History API, e.g. IE 9 or Android < 4.0.

waits on another Store that is already waiting.

The updated example uses constructs Promises up front and then
asynchronously resolves them.

Also affects the reverse case, adding a class that is scheduled to be removed with rAF.

The following case can happen when ngClass updates an element's classes in very quick order in the following way:

- First animation adds class ""a""
- A digest passes, but ""a"" is not yet added to the element
- Second animation adds class ""b""
- No digest passes, and ""a"" is still not added to the element,
  because requestAnimationFrame hasn't been flushed yet
- Third animation removes class ""a""
- the third animation gets merged into the second animation

Before this change:

- Because the element doesn't have class ""a"" yet, ngAnimate
resolves that it cannot remove class ""a"". However,
the first animation is still running, and finally adds ""a""

After this change:

- ngAnimate reacts to the temporary class ""add-a"", which indicates
that ""a"" is about to be added and decides that ""a"" can be removed
after all.

This is a very rare case where setting the element's class
is not fast enough, and subsequent animations operate on incorrect assumptions.

""In the wild"", this is caused by rapidly updating ngClass,
which uses inidvidual addClass and removeClass calls when both operations happen in a single digest.

When the select model changes, we add the ""selected"" attribute to the selected option, so that
screen readers know which option is selected.

Previously, we failed to remove the attribute from the selected / empty option when the model changed
to match a different option, or the unknown / empty option.

When using ""track by"", the behavior would also show when a user selected an option, and then the
model was changed, because track by watches the tracked expression, and calls the $render function
on change.

This fix reads the current select value, finds the matching option and removes the ""selected""
attribute.

IE9 had to be special cased, as it will report option.hasAttribute('selected') === true even
if the option's property and attribute have been unset (even the dev tools show not selected attribute).

I've added a custom matcher that accounts for this behavior. In all other browsers, property and
attribute should always be in the same state. Since few people will use screen readers with IE9, I
hope this is a satisfactory solution to the problem.

The key idea here is that you're always rendering `this.state.children`, not
`this.props.children`. When combined with `cloneWithProps()` this means we can
keep them in the DOM as long as we want. We add new children and reactively
update existing ones using `setState()` inside of `componentWillReceiveProps()`
so `this.state.children` always has the latest versions of components. Since we
may be keeping old components around that are no longer in
`this.props.children` we need a way to figure out where they should be inside
of the combined `this.state.children` list.  `ReactTransitionChildMapping` does
this for us.

Based on that infrastructure we can build the interface we always wanted: enter
and leave lifecycle hooks.

When a component is added to the DOM, `componentWillEnter(callback)` gets
called. Call the callback when you're done animating and `componentDidEnter()`
will be called.

When a component is about to be removed from the DOM,
`componentWillLeave(callback)` gets called. Call the callback when you're done
animating and `componentDidLeave()` will be called and the component will
*actually* be removed from the DOM. It won't be removed until you call the
callback.

These also handle ""concurrent"" changes. If you ""stack"" enter/leaves of a single
component before the animation has completed, it will block out all of those
animations until the current animation completes, and then finally it will
animate 0 or 1 times to get itself into the desired current state. This is what
differentiates `componentWillEnter()` from `componentDidMount()`.

The next step would be to build `componentDidReorder()`.

I've built `ReactCSSTransitionGroup` which is identical to the old
`ReactTransitionGroup` and codemodded the callsites.

after unit & e2e tests ran. The order was orginally changed as part of

While the logic is sound that style errors shouldn't block tests from
running, ddescribe should always run. This was not guaraneteed; when
Travis exits with a warning after some browsers have run, ddescribe
doesn't get run and it doesn't become apparent that not
all tests have run.

Additionally, a separate job clearly separates style from test errors,
which e.g. means you can open a PR that includes an iit to speed up
the job, and see immediately if the test passes, because the ddescribe
error is in another job.

If directives are required through an object hash, rather than a string or array,
the required directives' controllers are bound to the current directive's controller
in much the same way as the properties are bound to using `bindToController`.

This only happens if `bindToController` is truthy.

The binding is done after the controller has been constructed and all the bindings
are guaranteed to be complete by the time the controller's `$onInit` method
is called.

This change makes it much simpler to access require controllers without the
need for manually wiring them up in link functions. In particular this
enables support for `require` in directives defined using `mod.component()`

in 5ae63fd3 the comparison was made consistent but strict, so that

angular.equals({}, {foo: undefined}) // always returns false

this turns out to cause issues for data that is being roundtripped via network
and serialized via JSON because JSON.stringify serializes {foo: undefined} as {}.

Since angular.equals() behaved like this before the 5ae63fd3 in 50% of the cases,
changing the behavior in this way should not introduce any significant issues.

Before 1.3, it was possible to call `angular.mock.module()` from inside
another module. After this version additional calls were just ignored.

It is helpful to be able to do this since a test may have helper functions
that need to access ""config""-time things such as constants or providers,
and without this change it is difficult to get hold of the `$provide`
object from within those helpers.

$evalAsync triggers a digest, and is unsuitable when it is expected that a digest should not occur.

BREAKING CHANGE

Previously, even if invokeApply was set to false, a $rootScope digest would occur during promise
resolution. This is no longer the case, as promises returned from $timeout and $interval will no
longer trigger $evalAsync (which in turn causes a $digest) if `invokeApply` is false.

Workarounds include manually triggering $scope.$apply(), or returning $q.defer().promise from a
promise callback, and resolving or rejecting it when appropriate.

    var interval = $interval(function() {
      if (someRequirementFulfilled) {
        $interval.cancel(interval);
        $scope.$apply();
      }
    }, 100, 0, false);

or:

    var interval = $interval(function (idx) {
      // make the magic happen
    }, 1000, 10, false);
    interval.then(function(idx) {
      var deferred = $q.defer();
      // do the asynchronous magic --- $evalAsync will cause a digest and cause
      // bindings to update.
      return deferred.promise;

This commit fixes it by detecting a Chrome Packaged App (through the presence of

webpages as well, but it doesn't have the `runtime` property, which is only available to packaged

Setting `innerHTML` is slow: http://jsperf.com/react-child-creation/2

This reduces the number of times we set `innerHTML` by batching markup generation in a component tree.

As usual, I cleaned up the `ReactMultiChild` module significantly.

== Children Reconciliation ==

When a `ReactNativeComponent` reconciles, it compares currently rendered children, `prevChildren`, with the new children, `nextChildren`. It figures out the shortest series of updates required to render `nextChildren` where each update is one of:

 - Create nodes for a new child and insert it at an index.
 - Update an existing node and, if necessary, move it to an index.
 - Remove an existing node.

This serializable series of updates is sent to `ReactDOMIDOperations` where the actions are actually acted on.

== Problem ==

There are two problems:

 # When a `ReactNativeComponent` renders new children, it sets `innerHTML` once for each contiguous set of children.
 # Each `ReactNativeComponent` renders its children in isolation, so two components that both render new children will do so separately.

For example, consider the following update:

  React.renderComponent(<div><p><span /></p><p><span /></p></div>, ...);
  React.renderComponent(<div><p><img /><span /><img /></p><p><img /><span /><img /></p></div>, ...);

This will trigger setting `innerHTML` four times.

== Solution ==

Instead of enqueuing the series of updates per component, this diff changes `ReactMultiChild` to enqueue updates per component tree (which works by counting recursive calls to `updateChildren`). Once all updates in the tree are accounted for, we render all markup using a single `innerHTML` set.

The `$compile` public API documentation indicates that
a transclude function may be passed as a second parameter, but
it was not clear that this is **not** the same function that is given
to directive link functions as the `transcludeFn` parameter.

We would like to be able to pass in a transclude function the public
linking function that is returned from `$compile` if we wish to, for
example, use lazy compilation inside a directive.

Doing so, however, highlighted two bugs:

* First, the transclude function would get rebound, incorrectly, changing
its scope from its original binding.
* Second, the `containingScope` would not be updated and the wrong
`$parent` would be assigned to the `transcludedScope` resulting in a
memory leak.

This patch fixes both of these issues.

It also converts various private optional positional parameters on `publicLinkFn`
into an `options` parameter, which is an object hash. The new `options`
parameter is documented as part of the public API.

Thanks to @lgalfaso, @tbosch, and @petebacondarwin.

Ref: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/4045

I have this sinking feeling that support this use case sort of
encourages binding to function that blindly trust some html.  For now,
I'm fixing the issue while I think about the use cases some more.

In the case of a function that performs any non-trivial work before
wrapping the value (e.g. the showdown filter in issue #3980, or the
binding to a simply wrapper function in issue #3932 if it did anything
meaty), this fix makes it ""work"" - but performance is going to suck -
you should bind to some other thing on scope that watches the actual
source and adjusts itself when that changes (e.g. the showdown filter.)
For the case of the wrapper in #3932, if one isn't performing
sanitization or some such thing - then you the developer has insight
into why that value is safe in that particular context - and it should
be available simply by name and not as a result of a function taking any
arbitrary input to make auditing of security a little saner.

Closes #3932, #3980

Refactored all scripts so that they are divided into a `prepare`
and a `publish` phase. By this we can build, test, tag, commit
everything first. Only if all of this is ok we start pushing
to Github. By this we keep Github consistent even in error cases.

Extracted include script `/scripts/utils.inc`:
- parse and validate named arguments in the style
  `--name=value`
- proxy git command and deactivate `git push` based on
  command option `--git_push_dry_run=true`
  (will be inherited to child scripts)
- enable/disable bash debug mode by command option
  `--verbose=true`
- dispatch to functions based on command option
  `--action=...`
- helper functions for dealing with json files

- Configure our docs app to use new $location with html5 history api!

- Update simple node web server to serve index.html for all links

- Update .htaccess file to serve index.html for all links (rewritting).

- At runtime determine the base href path and attach it to the DOM. We
  needed the absolute URL to get all browsers to work well.

- Because of the above, we also need to dynamically determine all needed
  js/css resources and add them to the DOM. This was needed because FF6
  would eagerly fetch resources with wrong URL since the base element is
  added to the dom at runtime.

- All content html files were moved to the partials directory, because
  with the new html5 urls it was impossible to tell if request for
  http://domain/api/angular.filter.html was an html5 url for the html
  filter doc page, or an xhr/appcache request for the content html file
  for the html filter.

With this, ReactMultiChild handles all of the children-related operations for ReactDOMComponent so that we don't process operations out of order. This is necessary because ReactMultiChild does its own batching so there's no way without its cooperation to get the timing right here.

Ideally we'll factor this logic out a bit better in subsequent updates but this is the simplest way to fix #1232 which has embarrassingly been open for over a year.

The change unfortunatelly makes us incompatible with jQuery which always falls back to onLoad.

Not falling back to onLoad is a possible breaking change because if Angular was added to the document during DOMContentLoaded
document.readyState at this point is 'interactive' which we'd need to add to our check, but more importantly if more scripts
are added during DOMContentLoaded these won't be loaded before we bootstrap, which can cause angular modules not to be found
during bootstrap.

This load ordering issues is really just a cornercase that should be handled via manual bootstrap, but until jQuery has the same
behavior we shouldn't do something else.

This change gives us ~10% boost in Chrome, less or nothing in other browsers.

BREAKING CHANGE:  `this` in filters is now undefined and no longer the scope

It's a bad practice for filters to have hidden dependencies, so pulling stuff from scope directly
is not a good idea. Scope being the filter context was never documented as public api, so we don't
expect that any significant code depends on this behavior.

If an existing filter has a dependency on the scope instance, the scope reference can
be passed into the filter as a filter argument (this is highly discouraged for new code):

Before: `{{ user.name | customFilter }}`
After: `{{ user.name | customFilter:this }}`

Although `copy()` does not need to (and never will) support all kinds of objects, there is a
(not uncommon) usecase for supporting `Blob` objects:

`ngMock`'s `$httpBackend` will return a copy of the response data (so that changes in one test won't
affect others). Since returning `Blob` objects in response to HTTP requests is a valid usecase and
since `ngMocks`'s `$httpBackend` will use `copy()` to create a copy of that data, it is reasonable
to support `Blob` objects.
(I didn't run any benchmarks, but the additional check for the type of the copied element should
have negligible impact, compared to the other stuff that `copy()` is doing.)

If an ngSwitchWhen or ngSwitchDefault directive is on an element that also
contains a transclusion directive (such as ngRepeat) the new scope should
be the one provided by the bound transclusion function.

Previously we were incorrectly creating a simple child of the main ngSwitch
scope.

BREAKING CHANGE:
** Directive Priority Changed ** - this commit changes the priority
of `ngSwitchWhen` and `ngSwitchDefault` from 800 to 1200.  This makes their
priority higher than `ngRepeat`, which allows items to be repeated on
the switch case element reliably.

In general your directives should have a lower priority than these directives
if you want them to exist inside the case elements. If you relied on the
priority of these directives then you should check that your code still
operates correctly.

    most browser consider valid HTML may not pares properly here,
    but we do best effort. We treat this parser as untrusted.
 2) We have safe sanitizeWriter which treats its input (start, end, chars)

    Any attribute value must not start with 'javascript:'. This check

Originally we destroyed the oldValue by incrementaly copying over portions of the newValue
into the oldValue during dirty-checking, this resulted in oldValue to be equal to newValue
by the time we called the watchCollection listener.

The fix creates a copy of the newValue each time a change is detected and then uses that
copy *the next time* a change is detected.

To make `$watchCollection` behave the same way as `$watch`, during the first iteration
the listener is called with newValue and oldValue being identical.

Since many of the corner-cases are already covered by existing tests, I refactored the
test logging to include oldValue and made the tests more readable.

This removes some outdated advice which no longer is true against the latest angular version.

a very good example unit test, so additional work is needed here.

Currently, legacy browsers get to use a clever scheme for resolving relative URIs in html5Mode,
and resolve the URI relative to $location.path().

Currently, $location.path() can be '/' under certain circumstances, which means that when we
split $location.path() on '/' and later join by '/' after adding another path component,
we end up with '//pathComponent'. $$rewrite fails to deal with this correctly, and effectively
the $location is never changed from the root path.

This CL corrects this by ensuring that the duplicate '/' situation does not occur when resolving
relative URIs.

The fix is more complicated than I'd like it to be mainly because
we need to ensure that we don't create circular references between

result in a memory leak.

Also the differences between IE8, IE9 and normal browsers make testing
this ugly.

The example for $cacheFactory breaks when a user tries to update a value for a key.
Setting a new value for an existing key results in duplicate key entries in the key array, thus
breaking the ng-repeat directive. With this fix the key is only added if it isn't contained in the
cache.

When `options.delay` is passed into `$animateCss`the delay style would be
applied after the add/remove CSS classes are evaluated (for transitions).
At this point it is too late for the delay to be picked up (this
functionality however does work with keyfarme animations).

This patch ensures that the provided `options.delay` value is
applied before the CSS classes are applied to the element.

As discussed in issue 1326
(https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1326) transitionend events are
unreliable; they may not fire because the element is no longer painted,
the browser tab is no longer focused or for a range of other reasons.
This is particularly harmful during leave transitions since the leaving
element will be permanently stuck in the DOM (and possibly visible).

The ReactCSSTransitionGroup now requires timeouts to be passed in
explicitly for each type of animation. Omitting the timeout duration
for a transition now triggers a PropTypes warning with a link to the
updated documentation.

This change ensures that a module's config blocks are always invoked after all of its providers are
registered.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, config blocks would be able to control behaviour of provider registration, due to being
invoked prior to provider registration. Now, provider registration always occurs prior to configuration
for a given module, and therefore config blocks are not able to have any control over a providers
registration.

Example:

Previously, the following:

   angular.module('foo', [])
     .provider('$rootProvider', function() {
       this.$get = function() { ... }
     })
     .config(function($rootProvider) {
       $rootProvider.dependentMode = ""B"";
     })
     .provider('$dependentProvider', function($rootProvider) {
       if ($rootProvider.dependentMode === ""A"") {
         this.$get = function() {
           // Special mode!
         }
       } else {
         this.$get = function() {
           // something else
         }
       }
     });

would have ""worked"", meaning behaviour of the config block between the registration of ""$rootProvider""
and ""$dependentProvider"" would have actually accomplished something and changed the behaviour of the
app. This is no longer possible within a single module.

use with non-ES5 browsers, like IE8.

`finally` also goes well together with `catch` api that was added to
$q recently and is part of the DOM promises standard.

To migrate the code follow the example below:

Before:

$http.get('/foo').always(doSomething);

After:

$http.get('/foo').finally(doSomething);

$http.get('/foo')['finally'](doSomething);

Previously we defaulted just to A because of IE8 which had a hard time with applying css styles to HTMLUnknownElements.

This is no longer the case with IE9, so we should make restrict default to EA. Doing so will make it easier to create
components and avoid matching errors when creating new directives

BREAKING CHANGE: directives now match elements by default unless specific restriction rules are set via `restrict` property.

This means that if a directive 'myFoo' previously didn't specify matching restrictrion, it will now match both the attribute
and element form.

Before:

 <div my-foo></div> <---- my-foo attribute matched the directive
 <my-foo></my-foo>  <---- no match

After:

 <div my-foo></div> <---- my-foo attribute matched the directive
 <my-foo></my-foo>  <---- my-foo element matched the directive

It is not expected that this will be a problem in practice because of widespread use of prefixes that make ""<my-foo>"" like
elements unlikely.

Change HashMap to give $$hashKey also for functions so it will be possible to load multiple module
function instances. In order to prevent problem in angular's test suite,  added an option to HashMap
to maintain its own id counter and added cleanup of $$hashKey from all module functions after each
test.

Before this CL, functions were added to the HashMap via toString(), which could potentially return
the same value for different actual instances of a function. This corrects this behaviour by
ensuring that functions are mapped with hashKeys, and ensuring that hashKeys are removed from
functions and objects at the end of tests.

In addition to these changes, the injector uses its own set of UIDs in order to prevent confusingly
breaking tests which expect scopes or ng-repeated items to have specific hash keys.

select elements with ngModel will now set ngModel to option values added by ngValue.
This allows setting values of any type (not only strings) without the use of ngOptions.

Interpolations inside attributes can only be strings, but the ngValue directive uses attrs.$set,
which does not have any type restriction. Any $observe on the value attribute will therefore receive
the original value (result of ngValue expression). However, when a user selects an option, the browser
sets the select value to the actual option's value attribute, which is still always a string.
For that reason, when options are added by ngValue, we set the hashed value of the original value in
the value attribute and store the actual value in an extra map. When the select value changes, we
read access the actual value via the hashed select value.

Since we only use a hashed value for ngValue, we will have extra checks for the hashed values:
- when options are read, for both single and multiple select
- when options are written, for multiple select

I don't expect this to have a performance impact, but it should be kept in mind.

Closes #9842
Closes #6297

BREAKING CHANGE:

`<option>` elements added to `<select ng-model>` via `ngValue` now add their values in hash form, i.e.
`<option ng-value=""myString"">` becomes `<option ng-value=""myString"" value=""string:myString"">`.

This is done to support binding options with values of any type to selects.

This should rarely affect applications, as the values of options are usually not relevant to the
application logic, but it's possible that option values are checked in tests.

$sce is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS.

Strict Contextual Escaping
--------------------------

Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires
bindings in certain contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe
to use for that context One example of such a context is binding
arbitrary html controlled by the user via ng-bind-html-unsafe.  We
refer to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.

As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.

Note:  When enabled (the default), IE8 in quirks mode is not supported.
In this mode, IE8 allows one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use
of the expression() syntax.  Refer
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx
to learn more about them.  You can ensure your document is in standards
mode and not quirks mode by adding <!doctype html> to the top of your
HTML document.

SCE assists in writing code in way that (a) is secure by default and (b)
makes auditing for security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking,
etc. a lot easier.

Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:

  <input ng-model=""userHtml"">
  <div ng-bind-html-unsafe=""{{userHtml}}"">

Notice that ng-bind-html-unsafe is bound to {{userHtml}} controlled by
the user.  With SCE disabled, this application allows the user to render
arbitrary HTML into the DIV.  In a more realistic example, one may be
rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via bindings.  (HTML is
just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input
creates security vulnerabilities.)

For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,
to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.

How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that
was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you
ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some
properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?

To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can
determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that
context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done
for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,
sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps
allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API
exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.

In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses $sce.trustAs (and
shorthand methods such as $sce.trustAsHtml, etc.) to obtain values that
will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.

In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of
$sce.getTrusted(context, value) rather than to the value directly.
Directives use $sce.parseAs rather than $parse to watch attribute
bindings, which performs the $sce.getTrusted behind the scenes on
non-constant literals.

As an example, ngBindHtmlUnsafe uses $sce.parseAsHtml(binding
expression).  Here's the actual code (slightly simplified):

  var ngBindHtmlUnsafeDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {
    return function(scope, element, attr) {
      scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtmlUnsafe), function(value) {
        element.html(value || '');
      });
    };
  }];

Impact on loading templates
---------------------------

This applies both to the ng-include directive as well as templateUrl's
specified by directives.

By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and
protocol as the application document.  This is done by calling
$sce.getTrustedResourceUrl on the template URL.  To load templates from
other domains and/or protocols, you may either either whitelist them or
wrap it into a trusted value.

*Please note*:
The browser's Same Origin Policy and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
(CORS) policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether
the template is successfully loaded.  This means that without the right
CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain won't work on all
browsers.  Also, loading templates from file:// URL does not work on
some browsers.

This feels like too much overhead for the developer?
----------------------------------------------------

It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.

If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted
and you don't need to call $sce.trustAs on them.
e.g.  <div ng-html-bind-unsafe=""'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'""></div> just works.

Additionally, a[href] and img[src] automatically sanitize their URLs and
do not pass them through $sce.getTrusted.  SCE doesn't play a role here.

The included $sceDelegate comes with sane defaults to allow you to load
templates in ng-include from your application's domain without having to
even know about SCE.  It blocks loading templates from other domains or
loading templates over http from an https served document.  You can
change these by setting your own custom whitelists and blacklists for
matching such URLs.

This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the
small overhead and have an application that's secure and can be audited
to verify that with much more ease than bolting security onto an
application later.

This commit fixes the handling of min/max, and removes support for ngMin/ngMax:

min/max:
Previously, interpolated min/max values on input range were not set when the first $render happens,
because the interpolation directive only sets the actual element attribute value after
a digest passes. That means that the browser would not adjust
the input value according to min/max and the range input and model would
not be initialzed as expected. 
With this change, input range will set the actual element attribute value during its own
linking phase, as it is already available on the attrs argument passed to the link fn.

ngMin/ngMax
Since ng prefixed attributes do not set their corresponding element attribute, the range input would always have min = 0, and max = 100 (in supported browsers), regardless of the value
in ngMin/ngMax. This is confusing and not very useful, so it's better to not support these attributes at all.

The commit also fixes a test which used an interpolation inside an attribute that expects an expression.

Fixes #1392.

Previously, ReactComponent.updateComponent set the new props and owner and updated the component's refs. Because it did the actual props assignment, it had to be called by ReactCompositeComponent between componentWillMount and componentDidMount, meaning that it was skipped if shouldComponentUpdate returned false. Now, updateComponent takes the old and new descriptors and only updates refs, allowing a subclass to call updateComponent at a convenient time (specifically, it can be before `this._descriptor` is updated if the subclass also overrides performUpdateIfNecessary).

The new update cycle for composites is:

- receiveComponent is called which stores `this._pendingDescriptor` and calls performUpdateIfNecessary directly or a state update is enqueued, in which case ReactUpdates will call performUpdateIfNecessary
- performUpdateIfNecessary ensures that an update is still pending (which might no longer be the case if an update is queued for a subcomponent that was updated through a parent's reconciliation) and calls updateComponent with the old and new descriptors
- updateComponent calls super to update refs, then calls componentWillReceiveProps (if applicable) and shouldComponentUpdate -- if shouldComponentUpdate returns false, `this._descriptor`, `this.props`, and `this.state` are updated and the update is skipped; else, _performComponentUpdate is called
- _performComponentUpdate calls componentWillUpdate and _updateRenderedComponent, and enqueues the componentDidUpdate call (in that order)
- _updateRenderedComponent calls render and updates the rendered component appropriately

For DOM components (essentially unchanged):

- receiveComponent is called which does a short-circuit check for descriptor equality and delegates to super (which stores `this._pendingDescriptor` and calls performUpdateIfNecessary)
- performUpdateIfNecessary (not overridden) sets new values for `this.props`, etc. and calls updateComponent
- updateComponent does the DOM property and children updates (some synchronously, some queued for the transaction close)

For text and ART components (unchanged):

- receiveComponent updates the DOM or ART directly based on the new props
- updateComponent is never called

Notable changes:

- When shouldComponentUpdate returns false, refs are still updated
- ReactDefaultPerf now includes lifecycle methods in component timings
- updateComponent's signature changed (technically this is part of the public API, though we've never documented it)

When an error message contains an HTML string (e.g. `$location:nobase` containing `<base>`), it was
interpreted as a literal HTML element, instead of text. Error messages are not expected to render
as HTML, but we still need to use `.html()` in `errorDisplay`, so that the links created by
`errorLinkFilter` are properly displayed.
This commit solves this issue by replacing `<`/`>` with `&lt;`/`&gt;`.

This CL enables interpolation expressions to be escaped, by prefixing each character of their
start/end markers with a REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C, and to render the escaped expression as a
regular interpolation expression.

Example:

`<span ng-init=""foo='Hello'"">{{foo}}, \\{\\{World!\\}\\}</span>` would be rendered as:
`<span ng-init=""foo='Hello'"">Hello, {{World!}}</span>`

This will also work with custom interpolation markers, for example:

     module.
       config(function($interpolateProvider) {
         $interpolateProvider.startSymbol('\\\\');
         $interpolateProvider.endSymbol('//');
       }).
       run(function($interpolate) {
         // Will alert with ""hello\\bar//"":
         alert($interpolate('\\\\foo//\\\\\\\\bar\\/\\/')({foo: ""hello"", bar: ""world""}));
       });

This change effectively only changes the rendering of these escaped markers, because they are
not context-aware, and are incapable of preventing nested expressions within those escaped
markers from being evaluated.

Therefore, backends are encouraged to ensure that when escaping expressions for security
reasons, every single instance of a start or end marker have each of its characters prefixed
with a backslash (REVERSE SOLIDUS, U+005C)

In DOMPropertyOperations, we don't need to check hasOwnProperty if the property is in isStandardName because (with the exception of getPossibleStandardName) the dicts on DOMProperty will now be consistently populated with every valid attribute.

The unencoding happens in methods `encodeUriQuery`/`encodeUriSegment`. Both core and `ngResource`
used to have identical implementations of these methods. Due to this duplication, the
implementations got out-of-sync.

Specifically, the semicolon has been added to the whitelist of unencoded characters in core since
`v1.3.0-beta.18`. See 3625803 for more info.

This commit fixes the problem and the underlying cause by reusing core's methods in `ngResource`.

This uses the return value (an Error or nothing) to indicate whether a prop passes validation or not. It used to be done through calling `console.warn` as a side-effect, except this didn't work well with and `oneOfType`, which calls each validator.

The solution was to insert a `.weak` prop to each validator to suppress the warning message. This is overkill and also doesn't work well in because it increases the potential API surface. Plus, letting the validators warn it can't be easily used for logging, especially for custom validators.

So `.weak` is no longer needed: fixes https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/863.

Backward compatibility for custom validators: since they didn't return anything and directly call `console.warn` or something, this doesn't break them.

Improvements:

  - `arrayOf`, `oneOfType` and `oneOf` got better message now, since they can get hold of their validator's message and output that instead of a generic `warning: bla`.
  - More complete tests, including testing custom types and `isRequired` on everything.

Bug fixes:

  - oneOfType(...).isRequired didn't work. The workaround was to use `oneOfType(a.isRequired, b.isRequired, ...)`. This means `oneOfType(a.isRequired, b)` doesn't make sense. The new version simply makes `oneOfType(...).isRequired` possible.
  - `oneOf([true])` worked for 'true' boolean because it converted everything to string before comparing. It no longer does.
- `oneOf([true]).isRequired` didn't work.

As @leebyron and balpert pointed out, if the markup on the server is differnet than what the client expects undefined behavior and chaos may ensue. A good fallback
is for us to just inject the client-side markup (as it is the source of truth) and warn the user in __DEV__ that something is wrong. In order to do a fast
browser-independent check of the DOM I use an adler32 checksum of the generated markup. I believe this is better than a simple innerHTML compare because different
browsers massage innerHTML differently.

When compiling a `replace` directive, the compiler merges the attributes from
the replaced element onto the template element.

Unfortunately, `setAttribute` and other related DOM methods do not allow certain
attribute names - in particular Angular 2 style names such as `(click)` and `[value]`.

This is relevant when using ngForward with Angular Material, since the `mgButton`
directive uses `replace` and in the former you often use `(click)`.

This fixes the problem but for those special attributes the speed is considerably
slow.

IE8, IE9 and IE10 can use `script.onreadystate` so up till now we have been using this
if the sniffer says we are on IE.
But IE11 now does not support `script.onreadystate` and only supports the more standard
`script.onload` and `script.onerror`.
IE9 and IE10 do support `script.onload` and `script.onerror`. So now we only test whether
we are on IE8 or earlier before using `script.onreadystate`.
See http://pieisgood.org/test/script-link-events/

jQuery just uses all these handlers at once and hopes for the best, but since IE9 and IE10
support both sets of handlers, this could cause the handlers to be run more than once.

jQuery also notes that there is a potential memory leak in IE unless we remove the handlers
from the script object once they are run.  So we are doing this too, now.

BREAKING CHANGE: Concatenating expressions makes it hard to reason about
    whether some combination of concatenated values are unsafe to use
    and could easily lead to XSS.  By requiring that a single expression
    be used for *[src/ng-src] such as iframe[src], object[src], etc.
    (but not img[src/ng-src] since that value is sanitized), we ensure that the value
    that's used is assigned or constructed by some JS code somewhere
    that is more testable or make it obvious that you bound the value to
    some user controlled value.  This helps reduce the load when
    auditing for XSS issues.

    To migrate your code, follow the example below:

        Before:
            JS:
                scope.baseUrl = 'page';
                scope.a = 1;
                scope.b = 2;
            HTML:
                <!-- Are a and b properly escaped here? Is baseUrl
                     controlled by user? -->
                <iframe src=""{{baseUrl}}?a={{a}&b={{b}}"">

        After:
            JS:
                var baseUrl = ""page"";
                scope.getIframeSrc = function() {
                  // There are obviously better ways to do this.  The
                  // key point is that one will think about this and do
                  // it the right way.
                  var qs = [""a"", ""b""].map(function(value, name) {
                      return encodeURIComponent(name) + ""="" +
                             encodeURIComponent(value);
                    }).join(""&"");
                  // baseUrl isn't on scope so it isn't bound to a user
                  // controlled value.
                  return baseUrl + ""?"" + qs;
                }

This makes things easier if we ever want to use more than one DOM node for a component. Notably, this is more convenient if we want to remove the wrappers around text components (since text nodes can be split and joined however a browser feels like) or if we want to support returning more than one element from render (#2127).

I left the old indexes so that implementations aren't forced to use the node/image if they prefer indices, because I'm not sure yet whether the changes corresponding to my rewrite of DOMChildrenOperations are easy or hard yet in React Native. (The tests pass with and without the DOMChildrenOperations changes here.)

Change introduced by me in 8611ebe6 results in considerable inefficiencies when the compiler
and linker is used from within a widget, in which case, we call $digest unnecessary since it
will be called by the $apply which called the directive/widget in the first place.

There are only two places when the extra $digest call can be useful - when manually bootstrapping
the app or in tests. However even in tests this behavior can result in unwanted results (especially
when ng:controller is involved). So it is better to leave it for the developer to call $digest
when it is really needed.

If `ngMessage` tried to add a message back in that was about to be removed

node when it is attached. This is then checked when a DOM node is being
destroyed to prevent unwanted calls to `detach`.

future.

The decorated version of `$controller` is able to assign bindings to a controller instance prior to
instantiation, emulating the behavior of `$compile` with directive controllers.

There are cases, that the actual controller instance is different than the pre-populated one (e.g.
when the controller constructor function returns a value or when the controller is an ES2015 Class).
While `$compile` accounts for such situation, by re-asigning the bindings after the controller has
been instantiated, `ngMock`'s `$controller` didn't.

This commit fixes it, by re-applying the bindings if the actual controller instance is different
than the original one (similar to how `$compile` would do it).

This is a major re-structuring of the tutorial app's codebase, aiming at applying established best
practices (in terms of file naming/layout and code organization) and utilizing several new features
and enhancements (most notably components) introduced in recent versions of Angular (especially
v1.5).

Apart from the overall changes, two new chapters were introduced: one on components and one on code
organization.

--
In the process, several other things were (incidentally) taken care of, including:

* Dependencies were upgraded to latest versions.
* Animations were polished.
* Outdated links were updated.
* The app's base URL was changed to `/` (instead of `/app/`).

BTW, this has been tested with the following versions of Node (on Windows 10) and everything worked
fine:

* 0.11.16
* 4.2.6
* 4.4.2
* 5.10.0
* 6.2.0

--
This was inspired by (and loosely based on) #13834.
Again, mad props to @teropa for leading the way :)

--
**Note:**
The old version of the tutorial, that is compatible with Angular version 1.4 or older, has been
saved on the `pre-v1.5.0-snapshot` branch of
[angular-phonecat](https://github.com/angular/angular-phonecat). The `v1.4.x` version of the
tutorial should be pointed to that branch instead of `master`.

Related to angular/angular-phonecat#326.
Related to angular/angular-seed#341.

BREAKING CHANGE:
The `blur` and `focus` event fire synchronously, also during DOM operations
that remove elements. This lead to errors as the Angular model was not
in a consistent state. See this [fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/fq1dq5yb/) for a demo.

This change executes the expression of those events using
`scope.$evalAsync` if an `$apply` is in progress, otherwise
keeps the old behavior.

It turns out that if you try to browserify a file requiring react-tools,
it doesn't work. This is because browserify just visits the require
statements in the file and looks for files in that path.
./ReactCompositeComponent doesn't exist and that's the point that fails.
So the fix is to actually ship each of our CJS modules as individual
files like browserify expects. This should have no negative side effects
- we still only export React (though the rest of our modules are now
actually accessible, which might make it easier to do more with the
module).

The other change here is to move source-map to dependencies since it's
required in the transform code.

Test Plan:

```
$ npm pack .
$ cd /tmp
$ npm install path/to/react-tools-0.3.1.tgz
$ echo ""require('react-tools')"" > test.js
$ browserify test.js
```

Previously, css animations would not cancel the timeout when the
animation ends normally (calling end explicitly / transitionEnd event).
This meant that the timeout callback fn was always called after 150% of
the animation time was over. Since the animation was already closed at this
point, it would not do any work twice, but simply remove the timer data
from the element.
This commit changes the behavior to cancel the timeout and remove the data
when it is found during animation closing.

Currently it is possible to use `ngModelOptions` to pend model updates until form is submitted, but in case the user wants to reset the form back to its original values he must call `$rollbackViewValue` on each input control in the form. This commit adds a `$rollbackViewValue` on the form controller in order to make this operation easier, similarly to `$commitViewValue`.

Copying the $$hashKey as part of copy/extend operations makes little
sense since hashkey is used primarily as an object id, especially in
the context of the ngRepeat directive. This change maintains the
existing $$hashKey of an object that is being copied into (likewise for
extend).
It is not uncommon to take an item in a collection, copy it,
and then append it to the collection. By copying the $$hashKey, this
leads to duplicate object errors with the current ngRepeat.

caused the compilation context to be lost.

The previous logic for async validation in
`ngModelController` and `formController` was not maintainable:
- control logic is in multiple parts, e.g. `ctrl.$setValidity`
  waits for end of promises and continuous the control flow
  for async validation
- logic for updating the flags `ctrl.$error`, `ctrl.$pending`, `ctrl.$valid`
  is super complicated, especially in `formController`

This refactoring makes the following changes:
- simplify async validation: centralize control logic
  into one method in `ngModelController`:
  * remove counters `invalidCount` and `pendingCount`
  * use a flag `currentValidationRunId` to separate
    async validator runs from each other
  * use `$q.all` to determine when all async validators are done
- centralize way how `ctrl.$modelValue` and `ctrl.$invalidModelValue`
  is updated
- simplify `ngModelController/formCtrl.$setValidity` and merge
  `$$setPending/$$clearControlValidity/$$clearValidity/$$clearPending`
  into one method, that is used by `ngModelController` AND
  `formController`
  * remove diff calculation, always calculate the correct state anew,
    only cache the css classes that have been set to not
    trigger too many css animations.
  * remove fields from `ctrl.$error` that are valid and add private `ctrl.$$success`:
    allows to correctly separate states for valid, invalid, skipped and pending,
    especially transitively across parent forms.
- fix bug in `ngModelController`:
  * only read out `input.validity.badInput`, but not
    `input.validity.typeMismatch`,
    to determine parser error: We still want our `email`
    validator to run event when the model is validated.
- fix bugs in tests that were found as the logic is now consistent between
  `ngModelController` and `formController`

BREAKING CHANGE:
- `ctrl.$error` does no more contain entries for validators that were
  successful.
- `ctrl.$setValidity` now differentiates between `true`, `false`,
  `undefined` and `null`, instead of previously only truthy vs falsy.

Code cleanup! response interceptors have been deprecated for some time, and it is confusing to have
two APIs, one of which is slightly ""hidden"" and hard to see, which perform the same task. The newer
API is a bit cleaner and more visible, so this is naturally preferred.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, it was possible to register a response interceptor like so:

    // register the interceptor as a service
    $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
      return function(promise) {
        return promise.then(function(response) {
          // do something on success
          return response;
        }, function(response) {
          // do something on error
          if (canRecover(response)) {
            return responseOrNewPromise
          }
          return $q.reject(response);
        });
      }
    });

    $httpProvider.responseInterceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');

Now, one must use the newer API introduced in v1.1.4 (4ae46814), like so:

    $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q) {
      return {
        response: function(response) {
          // do something on success
          return response;
        },
        responseError: function(response) {
          // do something on error
          if (canRecover(response)) {
            return responseOrNewPromise
          }
          return $q.reject(response);
        }
      };
    });

    $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');

More details on the new interceptors API (which has been around as of v1.1.4) can be found at
https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http#interceptors

Currently, default props as defined by `getDefaultProps` are only used if a prop is not specified (using `X in Y` check).

However, this makes it difficult for composing components to pass along the state of not being defined, for example:

  render: function() {
    // If `this.props.someProp` is not set, `InnerThing` should use the default value.
    return <InnerThing someProp={this.props.someProp} />;
  }

This changes the requirement for falling back to the default value to an undefined check (using `typeof X === 'undefined'`).

`classList` was also considered as a solution, but because only IE10+ supports it, we
have to wait. :'(

Remove the touchmove handler so that resetState is not called on touchmove.
The touchend event handler already prevents the click from being triggered
if the distance moved exceeds the MOVE_TOLERANCE, so detection of touchmove
is not needed. Previously, because of resetState on touchmove, the click would
not be triggered even if the event coordinates changed by only 1px or 2px,

The orderBy filter now allows string predicates passed to the orderBy filter to make use property
name predicates containing non-ident strings, such as spaces or percent signs, or non-latin

This behaviour requires the predicate string to be double-quoted.

In markup, this might look like so:

```html
<div ng-repeat=""item in items | orderBy:'\""Tip %\""'"">

```js

...unless they already have a wrapper. Also, add tagName to every wrapper.

This ensures that refs are consistent. They always look like composite
components. This effectively hides the internal implementation details of
real DOM components since you can no longer get a ref to one.

In the future we might want to drop this wrapper and have refs refer
directly to the DOM node.

I currently use a hacky way of auto-wrapping inside of ReactNativeComponent
so that any given string can be wrapped. Better suggestions are welcome.

Deep-copying route definition objects can break specific custom implementations of `$sce` (used to
trust a `templateUrl` as RESOURCE_URL). The purpose of copying route definition objects was to guard
against the user's modifying the route definition object after route registration, while still
capturing inherited properties.
As suggested by @IgorMinar in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14699#discussion_r66480539,
we can achieve both _and_ support custom `$sce` implementations, by shallow-copying instead.

This is an alternative implementation for #14699, which avoids the breaking change.

The current `ReactInstanceHandles` has a bug where `findComponentRoot` barfs if it comes across a node that was not identified by React (via `ReactID`). This fixes that.

This was always a bug, but it became more apparent once we switched to `data-reactid` because arbitrary `document.createElement`'d nodes are much more likely to have an `id` than they are to have a `data-reactid`.

Extend ng-options with a new clause, ""track by [trackByExpression]"", which can be used when
working with objects.  The `trackByExpression` should uniquely identify select options objects.
This solves the problem of previously having to match ng-options objects by identity.
You can now write: `ng-options=""obj as obj.name for obj in objects track by obj.id""`
The ""track by"" expression will be used when checking for equality of objects.

Examples:
<select
    ng-model=""user.favMovieStub""
    ng-options=""movie as movie.name for movie in movies track by movie.id"">
</select>

scope: {
  user: { name: 'Test user', favMovieStub: { id: 1, name: 'Starwars' } }
  movies: [{ id: 1, name: 'Starwars', rating: 5, ... }, { id: 13, ... }]
}

The select input will match user favMovieStub to the first movie in the movies array, and show
""Star Wars"" as the selected item.

Includes the following fixes (per component):

* `$sniffer`: Properly determine the expected `vendorPrefix` for MS Edge
* `input`: MS Edge does not support dates with years with more than 4 digits.
      Trying to set the value of an `input[datetime-local]` to `9999-12-31T23.59.59.999` throws an
      error (probably related to converting the date to one with a year with more than 4 digits,
      due to timezone offset).
* `$sanitize`: Fix failing tests on MS Edge
* `$animateCss`: Although the detected `vendorPrefix` for MS Edge is ""ms"", it doesn't seem to
      recognize some vendor-prefixed CSS rules (e.g. `-ms-animation-*`). Other browsers (currently)
      recognize either vendor-prefixed rules only or both.
      Fixed by adding and retrieving styles using both prefixed and un-prefixed names.
* `$compile`: Skip failing `foreignObject` test on MS Edge.
      For unknown reasons, an `<svg>` element inside a `<foreignObject>` element on MS Edge has no
      size, causing the included `<circle>` element to also have no size and thus fails an
      assertion (relying on the element having a non-zero size).
      This seems to be an MS Edge issue; i.e. it is also reproducible without Angular.
      (Tested with MS Edge version 25.10586.0.0 on Windows 10.)

The original tests were flawed because the `Danger` module exploits the fact that all React-generated markup has at least one attribute. This allows the module to extract node names from markup strings faster.

However, the tests were passing in strings of markup with no attributes.

Also, this fixes a test failure due to the test trying to set text content into a `<tr>` which is typically disallowed by browsers (and PhantomJS). This changes it to use `<td>` instead.

This copies the propType and contextType validation to a wrapper around the
descriptor factory. By doing the validation early, we make it easier to track
down bugs. It also prepares for static type checking which should be done at the
usage site.

This validation is not yet active and is just logged using monitorCodeUse. This
will allow us to clean up callsites which would fail this new type of
validation.

I chose to copy the validation of abstracting it out since this is just an
intermediate step to avoid spamming consoles. This makes more a much cleaner
diff review/history. The original validation in the instance will be deleted as
soon as we can turn on the warnings.

Additionally, getDefaultProps are moved to become a static function which is
only executed once. It should be moved to statics but we don't have a
convenient way to merge mixins in statics right now. Deferring to ES6 classes.

This is still a breaking change since you can return an object or array from
getDefaultProps, which later gets mutated and now the shared instance is
mutated. Mutating an object that is passed into you from props is highly
discouraged and likely to lead to subtle bugs anyway. So I'm not too worried.

The defaultProps will later be resolved in the descriptor factory. This will
enable a perf optimizations where we don't create an unnecessary object
allocation when you use default props. It also means that ReactChildren.map
has access to resolved properties which gives them consistent behavior whether
or not the default prop is specified.

Previously if there was a hash fragment but no hashPrefix we would throw an error.
Now we assume that the hash-bang path is empty and that the hash is a valid fragment.

This prevents unnecessary exceptions where we clear the hashBang path, say by
navigating back to the base url, where the $browser leaves an empty hash symbol
on the URL to ensure there is no browser reload.

BREAKING CHANGE:

We no longer throw an `ihshprfx` error if the URL after the base path
contains only a hash fragment.  Previously, if the base URL was `http://abc.com/base/`
and the hashPrefix is `!` then trying to parse `http://abc.com/base/#some-fragment`
would have thrown an error. Now we simply assume it is a normal fragment and
that the path is empty, resulting `$location.absUrl() === ""http://abc.com/base/#!/#some-fragment""`.

This should not break any applications, but you can no longer rely on receiving the
`ihshprfx` error for paths that have the syntax above. It is actually more similar
to what currently happens for invalid extra paths anyway:  If the base URL
and hashPrfix are set up as above, then `http://abc.com/base/other/path` does not
throw an error but just ignores the extra path: `http://abc.com/base`.

It was possible to run arbitrary JS from inside angular expressions using the

Fix that by blocking access to `Object` because `Object` isn't accessible
without tricks anyway and it provides some other nasty functions.

BREAKING CHANGE:
This prevents the use of `Object` inside angular expressions.
If you need Object.keys, make it accessible in the scope.

In the version of V8 used in Chrome < 50, the parent of template nodes for

This bug surfaced due to the introduction of lazy transclusion (652b83e),

It should be removed some time after Chrome 50 has been released.

I will do more cleanup in follow ups. The purpose of this diff is to

The other big change: this removes the need for the @jsx pragma.
Instead we'll parse everything, assume React is in scope,

runing the transform when @jsx was specified in the docblock).

Note: this is actually a series of commits internally and should have
been syned out in pieces over the past several weeks.

This commit deprecates the ngClick directive from the ngTouch module.
Additionally, it disables it by default. It can be enabled in the new $touchProvider with
the $touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled() method.

The directive was conceived to remove the 300ms delay
for click events on mobile browsers, by sending a synthetic click event on touchstart.
It also tried to make sure that the original click event that the browser sends after 300ms
was ""busted"", so that no redundant ""ghost-clicks"" appear.

There are various reasons why the directive is being deprecated.

- ""This is an ugly, terrible hack!"" (says so in the source)
- It is plagued by various bugs that are hard to fix / test for all platforms (see below)
- Simply including ngTouch activates the ngClick override, which means even if you simply want
to use ngSwipe, you may break parts of your app
- There exist alternatives for removing the 300ms delay, that can be used very well with Angular:
[FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick), [Tappy!](https://github.com/filamentgroup/tappy/)
(There's also hammer.js for touch events / gestures)
- The 300ms delay itself is on the way out - Chrome and Firefox for Android remove the 300ms delay
when the usual `<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">` is set. In IE, the
`touch-action` css property can be set to `none` or `manipulation` to remove the delay. Finally,
since iOs 8, Safari doesn't delay ""slow"" taps anymore. There are some caveats though, which can be
found in this excellent article on which this summary is based: http://developer.telerik.com/featured/300-ms-click-delay-ios-8/

Note that this change does not affect the `ngSwipe` directive.

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `ngClick` override directive from the `ngTouch` module is **deprecated and disabled by default**.
This means that on touch-based devices, users might now experience a 300ms delay before a click event is fired.

If you rely on this directive, you can still enable it with the `$touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled()`method:

```js
angular.module('myApp').config(function($touchProvider) {
  $touchProvider.ngClickOverrideEnabled(true);
});
```

For migration, we recommend using [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick).
Also note that modern browsers remove the 300ms delay under some circumstances:
- Chrome and Firefox for Android remove the 300ms delay when the well-known `<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width"">` is set
- Internet Explorer removes the delay when  `touch-action` css property is set to `none` or `manipulation`
- Since iOs 8, Safari removes the delay on so-called ""slow taps""

See this [article by Telerik](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/300-ms-click-delay-ios-8/) for more info on the topic.
Note that this change does not affect the `ngSwipe` directive.

1) This allows the element to always remain on the young generation.

3) This conveniently means that we don't have to create a fake element for

We were shallow-rendering a component that used refs at FB so this can't go in as-is.

Also, changing shallow rendering to use the original `_renderValidatedComponent` (instead of `_renderValidatedComponentWithoutOwnerOrContext`) breaks tests because now the `_owner` field doesn't match up for `toEqual` (non-null in `getRenderOutput` but null if constructed in a test).

Transcluded scopes are now connected to the scope in which they are created
via their `$parent` property. This means that they will be automatically destroyed
when their ""containing"" scope is destroyed, without having to resort to listening
for a `$destroy` event on various DOM elements or other scopes.

Previously, transclude scope not only inherited prototypically from the scope from
which they were transcluded but they were also still owned by that ""outer"" scope.
This meant that there were scenarios where the ""real"" container scope/element was
destroyed but the transclude scope was not, leading to memory leaks.

The original strategy for dealing with this was to attach a `$destroy` event handler
to the DOM elements in the transcluded content, so that if the elements were removed
from the DOM then their associated transcluded scope would be destroyed.

This didn't work for transclude contents that didn't contain any elements - most
importantly in the case of the transclude content containing an element transclude
directive at its root, since the compiler swaps out this element for a comment
before a destroy handler could be attached.

BREAKING CHANGE:

`$transclude` functions no longer attach `$destroy` event handlers to the
transcluded content, and so the associated transclude scope will not automatically
be destroyed if you remove a transcluded element from the DOM using direct DOM
manipulation such as the jquery `remove()` method.

If you want to explicitly remove DOM elements inside your directive that have
been compiled, and so potentially contain child (and transcluded) scopes, then
it is your responsibility to get hold of the scope and destroy it at the same time.

The suggested approach is to create a new child scope of your own around any DOM
elements that you wish to manipulate in this way and destroy those scopes if you
remove their contents - any child scopes will then be destroyed and cleaned up
automatically.

Note that all the built-in directives that manipulate the DOM (ngIf, ngRepeat,
ngSwitch, etc) already follow this best practice, so if you only use these for
manipulating the DOM then you do not have to worry about this change.

If a select directive was bound, using ng-model, to a property with a value of null this would
result in an unknown option being added to the select element with the value ""? object:null ?"".
This change prevents a null value from adding an unknown option meaning that the extra option is
not added as a child of the select element.

Since select (without ngOptions) can only have string value options then `null` was never a
viable option value, so this is not a breaking change.

This introduces `ReactLink` which is a super lightweight way to do two-way binding for React.

If you want to use a controlled form input today, it's a lot of lines of code:

http://jsfiddle.net/T3z3v/

Look how many times `name` is repeated in there. And you have to remember to wire up event handles and pass the right state and
right event handler for *each* form field. It's really annoying.

With ReactLink, you can ""link"" a form value to a state field. It's just some simple sugar around the value prop/onChange
convention:

https://gist.github.com/petehunt/6689857

Ah, much nicer! And requires very little core changes or extra bytes. `ReactLink` just wraps the current value and ""request
change"" handler into a little object and provides some sugar to create some from composite component state.

Since developers are allowed to customize start/end interpolation

customizations, we should standardize on {{ }} in templates of
reusable (third-party) directives. During the compilation, these
templates are then denormalized to use whatever the custom
start/end symbol is, effectively translating the template into the
syntax of the runtime environment.

This addresses an issue raised at http://goo.gl/e8VPV

Existing code should not be affected by this change since project
that do use custom interpolation markers are not expected to use
{{ }} in existing directive templates.

Add support for collecting current stack trace information in browsers
(e.g. IE10+, PhantomJS) that do not automatically store the current stack trace
information in a newly created `Error` object's `stack` property, but
only add it there once the `Error` gets thrown.

The original implementation works fine in Firefox & Chrome, but fails on IE10+
and PhantomJS where it, for example, breaks Karma's error reporting in cases
when an exception is thrown in a test like the following:

```
it('the holy crusade', inject(function() {
  var x = {};
  x.holyGrail();
}));
```

In this case, the ngMock `inject()` implementation would incorrectly add the
word `undefined` at the end of the collected error stack trace information,
thus causing the main error description to be reported back to Karma as
`undefined`.

The added test makes sure this functionality:

- works as expected in browsers supporting JavaScript stack trace
  collection, e.g. Chrome, Firefox, IE10+, Opera & PhantomJS
- does not add any bogus stack track information in browsers that do
  not support JavaScript stack trace collection, e.g. IE9

This commit positively affects performance in two main ways:

1,  When wrapping text nodes in the compile step, we do not need the overhead
of the `forEach` function versus a normal for loop since we do not make
use of the closure for anything.

2.  When actually wrapping the node, we can completely bypass jqLite which
avoids several function calls and the overhead of cloning the wrapper node
which we already know to be unique.

Tests in applications show about an 83% decrease in time spent in this
specific loop.

When using two-way binding with isolate scope, under some circumstances
the lastValue variable captured in the parentValueWatch function can get
out of sync.

Specifically, if both the value in the origin scope as well as the value
in the isolate scope get independently updated to the same value within
one digest cycle, the lastValue is never updated. This potentially causes
the watch to make the wrong decision as to which side to update on subsequent
passes.

This fixes things by ensuring lastValue is always set to the last seen
value even if the watch's logic was short circuited because there was no
difference between the values in the original and isolate scopes.

- when the model does not match any option, the select generates an unknown option with the value
'? hashedModelVal ?' (select) or simply '?' (ngOptions) and inserts it into the select. This
option is then auto-selected by the browser. Once the user selects an option / the application sets
a matching model, the unknown option is removed from the select. It is therefore not user-selectable.

Alternatively, the application can provide an option with the value='', the so-called empty option.
The empty option takes over the role of the unknown option, in that it is selected when there's no
matching model, but it is not removed when a option and model match, and it can also be selected by
the user. The empty option has the value='' and sets the model to  if selected.

Previously, these concepts where a bit mushy, especially in ngOptions.

This fix now delegates the bulk of the work to the selectCtrl, as the concept of unknown and empty
option are the same for both directives. Only the generation of the empty option is different.

The commit also adjusts a test for an officially unsupported use-case: multiple empty options.
The new behavior is that the empty option that is registered last is used. The other one is still
present. Otherwise, this behavior is unspecified, and the docs are clear that only a single empty
option is allowed. We support dynamically generated empty options, but not multiple ones. I've left
the test to highlight that this might be someone's use case, and the we are aware of it.

Previously, the jqLite constructor was limited and would be unable to circumvent many of the HTML5
spec's ""allowed content"" policies for various nodes. This led to complicated and gross hacks around
this in the HTML compiler.

This change refactors these hacks by simplifying them, and placing them in jqLite rather than in
$compile, in order to better support these things, and simplify code.

While the new jqLite constructor is still not even close to as robust as jQuery, it should be more
than suitable enough for the needs of the framework, while adding minimal code.

This essentially copies all classic element creation tests to the modern
JSX tests. The classic tests doesn't use JSX and modern tests do.

The idea is that the JSX tests can start dropping dynamic checks once
we have Flow support for those features. JSX won't be necessary for
dropping dynamic checks. Plain object will also work. Flow will also not
be necessary for JSX. However, the tests should test for the suggested
combination (JSX + Flow).

This also moves some misplaced tests to ReactDOM and Validator.

Note that the modern tests uses ES6 classes. I will add separate tests for
those. However, these are not guaranteed to have .displayName so all our
error messages should check .name if available instead. This should be
better abstracted but I just adhoc fix this for now.

This fixes the last known parts of the flattening experiment. This has grown to
be somewhat complex and potentially fragile because of it. We may end up
reverting flattening in the future or address it slightly differently.

The purpose of this diff is to test if we've finally understood the real world
edge cases that flattening can lead to and how we have to key components to
cover those cases.

With this commit we never rekey the internal _key property. The semantics is
that once a component passes through a composite component, it's identity is
frozen.

props.key should accept numeric values and booleans which includes 0 and false.
This fixes the truthiness check.

We should never warn about missing key properties if a component is passed as a
static child. The _key acts as a flag to determine whether this component
was checked already.

I originally did this work so that we could allow setState to be called
before the internal ReactCompositeComponent was constructed. It's unlikely
that we'll go down that route now but this still seems like a better
abstraction. It communicates that this is not immediately updating an
object oriented class. It's just a queue which a minor optimization.
It also avoids bloating the ReactCompositeComponent file.

Since they both depend on the life cycle I break that out into a common
shared dependency. In a follow up I'll refactor the life-cycle management.

Although it would have been nice to prime the entire tree and achieve a
cache hit rate of 100%, that cost would have to be paid up front, during
page rendering.

This patch avoids priming up front in favor of making the most of the work
done by `ReactMount.findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow`, which calls
`ReactID.getID` while traversing the rendered DOM. The insight is this: if
`getID` simply primes the cache whenever it finds a new ID, then
`findReactRenderedDOMNodeSlow` will end up priming quite a few more nodes
that are actually involved in `ReactID.getNode` lookups, and we won't need
`primeTree` at all.

This reverts commit 63cd873fef3207deef30c7a7ed66f4b8f647dc12.

The change breaks existing tests of Google apps. The problem is that
while we tried to avoid adding #/ to window.location.href unnecessarily
we failed doing so. Likely because by setting $path, at some point
(during a digest) we try to check if $location changed and we mistake the
default '/' with an explicit settign of the path via the `path()` method.
This results in us writing the url with '#/' into $browser.url() which updates
the window.location by adding ""#/"" to the url - something we tried to avoid
in the first place.

I'll reopen PR #5712.

`ngScenario` is deprecated, and we expect to remove it from the project in 1.6,

So in preparation for removing `ngScenario` we are relocating `browserTrigger`

Although many people are using browserTrigger in their own application testing
we are still not yet ready to make this a public API; so developers use
this helper at their own risk.

Because the constructor hasn't returned yet.

We used to have a special case for calling setState in getInitialState

Previously, the directive bindings were evaluated against the directive's
new (non-isolate) scope, instead of the correct (parent) scope.
This went unnoticed most of the time, since a property would be eventually
looked up in the parent scope due to prototypal inheritance. The incorrect
behaviour was exhibited when a property on the child scope was shadowing
that on the parent scope.

plus we will also avoid the (potentially big) string allocation.

The compiler adds scope information (`ng-scope` CSS class and `$scope` data property) to elements
when the are bound to the scope. This is mostly to aid debugging tools such as Batarang. In
production this should be unnecesary and adds a performance penalty.

In the bench/apps/largetable-bp this change caused an improvement of ~100ms (7%).

This can be now disabled by calling `$compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false)`
in a module `config` block:
```
someModule.config(['$compileProvider', function($compileProvider) {
  $compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false);
}]);
```

In the bench/apps/largetable-bp benchmark this change, with debug info disabled,
improved by ~120ms, that is ~10%.
Measuring the ""create"" phase, 25 loops, mean time ~1200ms -> ~1080ms.

- By default the runner now creates multiple output formats as it runs. Nodes are created in the DOM with ids: json, xml, and html.

ex. $('#json').html() => json output of the runner
ex. $('#xml').html() => json output of the runner

$result is also an object tree result.

The permitted formats are html,json,xml,object.

If you don't want certain formats you can select specific ones with the new ng:scenario-output attribute on the script tag.

<script src=""angular-scenario.js"" ng:scenario-output=""xml,json"">

- Added element(...).count() that returns the number of matching elements for the selector.

- repeater(...).count() now returns 0 if no elements matched which can be used to check if a repeater is empty.

- Added toBe() matcher that does strict equality with ===

- Implement iit and ddescribe. If iit() is used instead of it() then only that test will run. If ddescribe() is used instead of describe() them only it() statements inside of it will run. Several iit/ddescribe() blocks can be used to run isolated tests.

- Implement new event based model for SpecRunner. You can now listen for events in the runner. This is useful for writing your own UI or connecting a remote process (ex. WebDriver). Event callbacks execute on the Runner instance.

Events, if fired, will always be in the below order. All events always happen
except for Failure and Error events which only happen in error conditions.

Events:
  RunnerBegin
  SpecBegin(spec)
  StepBegin(spec, step)
  StepError(spec, step, error)
  StepFailure(spec, step, error)
  StepEnd(spec, step)
  SpecError(spec, step, error)
  SpecEnd(spec)
  RunnerEnd

- Only allow the browser to repaint every 10 steps. Cuts 700ms off Firefox in benchmark, 200ms off Chrome.

- Bug Fix: Manually navigate anchors on click since trigger wont work in Firefox.

Previously, a property would not be passed as query param, if `Object.prototype` had a property with
the same name.

Fixes #14866
Closes #14867

BREAKING CHANGE:

All owned properties of the `params` object that are not used to replace URL params, will be passed
to `$http` as `config.params` (to be used as query parameters in the URL), even if
`Object.prototype` has a property with same name. E.g.:

Before:

```js
var Foo = $resource('/foo/:id');
Foo.get({id: 42, bar: 'baz', toString: 'hmm'});
    // URL: /foo/42?bar=baz
    // Note that `toString` is _not_ included in the query,
    // because `Object.prototype.toString` is defined :(
```

After:

```js
var Foo = $resource('/foo/:id');
Foo.get({id: 42, bar: 'baz', toString: 'hmm'});
    // URL: /foo/42?bar=baz&toString=hmm
    // Note that `toString` _is_ included in the query, as expected :)

Previously, specifying a negative `begin` whose abs value exceeds the
input's length, would behave unexpectedly (depending on the value of
`limit` relative to `begin`). E.g.:

```
limitToFilter('12345', 3, -7) === '1'
// but
limitToFilter('12345', 10, -7) === '123'
```

This commit fixes the unexpected behaviour, by setting `begin` to 0 in the
aforementioned cases. Thus, the previous examples become:

```
limitToFilter('12345', 3, -7) === limitToFilter('12345', 3, 0) === '123'
// and
limitToFilter('12345', 10, -7) === limitToFilter('12345', 10, 0) === '12345'
```

This took a while to figure out, but we need to be able to store
children that are currently being worked on separately from the
current children. We always need a canonical ""current"" children
so that we can update them. However, we also need a different set
that we're currently working on so that we have a way to get to
already progressed work.

This solve the starvation problem in the first render because now
we can reach children that were never rendered and have a place
to store their progressed work on. The unit test changes tests
this.

This lets us get rid of the hasWorkInProgress flag.

When we reconcile new children we need to reconcile them against
progressed work so that we can reuse it. The progressed work is
""work in progress"" nodes. So in that case we need to mutate
instead of clone, to preserve the invariant that only two versions
exist at any given point. This effectively forks the
ReactChildFiber implementation.

Summary:
Right now, if a component specifies a propType as, for example,
`myProp: React.PropTypes.shape`, without an actual shape
parameter, any prop type will be accepted, because
`React.PropTypes.shape` returns a function (the actual validator),
not an Error, currently indicating that propType checking passed.

This can create an unfortunate situation where a component looks
like it has fully specified `propTypes`, but in fact does not.

This commit addresses this by warning if a propType checker returns
anything non-falsy that is not an Error (currently all the library
PropTypes return null or an Error).

Test Plan:
Added a unit test; ran `jest` in the root repo directory.
Also ran `grunt lint` and `grunt test`

Previously, `ngAria` would overwrite the default `ngModelController.$isEmpty()` method for custom
`checkbox`-shaped controls (e.g. `role=""checkbox""` or `role=""menuitemcheckbox""`), using the same
implementation as `input[checkbox]` (i.e. `value === false`). While this makes sense for
`input[checkbox]` which also defines a custom parser, it doesn't make sense for a custom `checkbox`
out-of-the-box. For example, an unintialized value (`undefined`) would make the checkbox appear as
""checked"".

If the user wants to provide a custom parser (e.g. setting falsy values to `false`), then they
should also provide a custom `$isEmpty()` method.

As a side effect, this commit solves issue #14621. (We could have solved it in different ways.)

Fixes #14621
Closes #14625

BREAKING CHANGE:

Custom `checkbox`-shaped controls (e.g. checkboxes, menuitemcheckboxes), no longer have a custom
`$isEmpty()` method on their `NgModelController` that checks for `value === false`. Unless
overwritten, the default `$isEmpty()` method will be used, which treats `undefined`, `null`, `NaN`
and `''` as ""empty"".

**Note:** The `$isEmpty()` method is used to determine if the checkbox is checked (""not empty"" means
          ""checked"") and thus it can indirectly affect other things, such as the control's validity
          with respect to the `required` validator (e.g. ""empty"" + ""required"" --> ""invalid"").

Before:

```js
var template = '<my-checkbox role=""checkbox"" ng-model=""value""></my-checkbox>';
var customCheckbox = $compile(template)(scope);
var ctrl = customCheckbox.controller('ngModel');

scope.$apply('value = false');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> true

scope.$apply('value = true');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false

scope.$apply('value = undefined'/* or null or NaN or '' */);
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false
```

After:

```js
var template = '<my-checkbox role=""checkbox"" ng-model=""value""></my-checkbox>';
var customCheckbox = $compile(template)(scope);
var ctrl = customCheckbox.controller('ngModel');

scope.$apply('value = false');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false

scope.$apply('value = true');
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> false

scope.$apply('value = undefined'/* or null or NaN or '' */);
console.log(ctrl.$isEmpty());   //--> true
```

--
If you want to have a custom `$isEmpty()` method, you need to overwrite the default. For example:

```js
.directive('myCheckbox', function myCheckboxDirective() {
  return {
    require: 'ngModel',
    link: function myCheckboxPostLink(scope, elem, attrs, ngModelCtrl) {
      ngModelCtrl.$isEmpty = function myCheckboxIsEmpty(value) {
        return !value;   // Any falsy value means ""empty""

        // Or to restore the previous behavior:
        // return value === false;
      };
    }
  };
})
```

Full list of changes is at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/2-to-3/. The tl;dr of it is:
 - Relative permalinks were removed, so all the files in the `docs` subdirectory need their permalink to be prefixed with `docs/`
 - `post` and `page` types were renamed to `posts` and `pages` respectively
 - `jekyll-paginate`, `pygments` and `redcarpet` are all now optional, so I needed to explicitly add it to the Gemfile. Jekyll now uses `rouge` rather than `pygments` for syntax highlighting, but rouge does not support highlighting individual lines (`hl_lines`) so we need to continue using Pygments.
 - Layout metadata (eg. `sectionid`) is now on a `layout` variable rather than `page`

Tested the following pages and confirmed that they all work:

Previously, ngMessage elements used the same scope as ngMessages. When ngMessage
has interpolation in the textContent, then removing the message would not remove
the watcher from the scope - it would only be removed when the whole ngMessages
element was removed.

This commit changes the ngMessage transclude function to create a new child scope
instead, which can be destroyed safely when the message element is removed and
the message is detached

This fixes known browser bugs with rendering markup using `innerHTML` in IE ([[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/276228 | here is an example of one]]).

This is a subset of what `HTML` (and jQuery) does, and we should eventually consider pulling it out into a separate module to reduce code duplication. For now, this is the minimal set of changes needed to unbreak React in production.

We can afford to use a subset of what `HTML` does because we have the luxury of knowing that the markup is generated sanely with proper closing tags, etc.

This change adds in the following new lifecycle hooks, which map in some
way to those in Angular 2:

 * `$onChanges(changesObj)` - Called whenever one-way bindings are updated. The `changesObj` is a hash whose keys
   are the names of the bound properties that have changed, and the values are an object of the form
   `{ currentValue: ..., previousValue: ... }`. Use this hook to trigger updates within a component such as
   cloning the bound value to prevent accidental mutation of the outer value.
 * `$onDestroy` - Called on a controller when its containing scope is destroyed. Use this hook for releasing
   external resources, watches and event handlers.
 * `$postLink` - Called after this controller's element and its children been linked. Similar to the post-link
   function this hook can be used to set up DOM event handlers and do direct DOM manipulation.
   Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled and linked since
   they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own compilation and linking has been
   suspended until that occurs.

Previously, even when `ng-jq` was empty (which should force the use of
jqLite), Angular tried to find jQuery on `window['']`. If it didn't find
anything there, it would fall back to jqLite (as expected).

Nonetheless, trying to access `window['']` calls `getElementById('')`,
which issues a warning in Firefox (maybe others).

This fix properly detects when `ng-jq` is empty and avoids trying to
access `window['']`.

`resolveRedirectTo` can be set to a function that will (eventually) return the new URL to redirect
to. The function supports dependency injection and should return the new URL either as a string or
as a promise that will be resolved to a string.

If the `resolveRedirectTo` function returns `undefined` or returns a promise that gets resolved to
`undefined`, no redirection will take place and the current route will be processed normally.

If the `resolveRedirectTo` function throws an error or the returned promise gets rejected, no
further processing will take place (e.g. no template fetched, no `resolve` functions run, no
controller instantiated) and a `$routeChangeError` will be broadcasted.

`redirectTo` takes precedence over `resolveRedirectTo`, so specifying both on the same route
definition, will cause the latter to be ignored.

Fixes #5150

Closes #14695

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, if `redirectTo` was a function that threw an Error, execution was aborted without firing
a `$routeChangeError` event.
Now, if a `redirectTo` function throws an Error, a `$routeChangeError` event will be fired.

Instead of simply logging the React ID of the `ancestorNode` when `findComponentRoot` fails, use a `try ... finally` to `console.error` the `ancestorNode`. This allows modern web inspectors to actually log a reference to the node (which may not have a React ID).

This means when people run into the problem, they will not have to execute:

  require('ReactID').getNode(<copy+paste>);

NOTE: Admittedly, this will not log anything in IE8. That's fine, since IE8 has shitty console logging anyway.

This handy service is designed to download and cache template contents
and to throw an error when a template request fails.

BREAKING CHANGE

Angular will now throw a $compile minErr each a template fails to download
for ngView, directives and ngMessage template requests. This changes the former
behavior of silently ignoring failed HTTP requests--or when the template itself
is empty. Please ensure that all directive, ngView and ngMessage code now properly
addresses this scenario. NgInclude is uneffected from this change.

The basic approach is to introduce a new elt.data() called $classCounts that keeps
track of how many times ngClass, ngClassEven, or ngClassOdd tries to add a given class.
The class is added only when the count goes from 0 to 1, and removed only when the
count hits 0.

To avoid duplicating work, some of the logic for checking which classes
to add/remove move into this directive and the directive calls $animate.

don't support location href, we use location.replace to reload the page
with the hashbang equivalent of the url but this fails with infinite
digest. This is because location.replace doesn't update location.href
synchronously on IE8 and 9.

While looking up a detail of how `transferPropsTo()` works I noticed that we never check `TransferStrategies.hasOwnProperty(thisKey)` when merging props, just `newProps.hasOwnProperty(thisKey)` and a truthy test for `TransferStrategies[thisKey]`. This means that if our `newProps` has keys like `toString`, `valueOf`, or `constructor` etc. set, we will pull these functions off `TransferStrategies` and invoke them when merging props. In most cases this will just result in a failure to merge and some code without side effects being run but in the case of `valueOf` it will actually generate an exception.

Firing a digest at the beginning of the verification process, ensures that requests fired
asynchronously - e.g. in the `resolve` handler of a promise as happens with `$http` - will get
detected as well.
Previously, in order to reliably verify that there was no outstanding request, users needed to
manually trigger a digest, before calling `verifyNoOutstandingRequest()`. Failing to do so, could
prevent `verifyNoOutstandingRequest()` from detecting pending requests and cover bugs in application
code.
This is no longer the case, since a digest will always be fired autommatically as part of a call to
`verifyNoOutstandingRequest()`.

Fixes #13506
Closes #13513

BREAKING CHANGE:

Calling `$httpBackend.verifyNoOutstandingRequest()` will trigger a digest. This will ensure that
requests fired asynchronously will also be detected (without the need to manually trigger a digest).
This is not expected to affect the majority of test-suites. Most of the time, a digest is (directly
or indirectly) triggered anyway, before calling `verifyNoOutstandingRequest()`.
In the unlikely case that a test needs to verify the timing of a request with respect to the digest
cycle, you should rely on other means, such as mocking and/or spying.

WebKit added support for the json responseType value on 09/03/2013
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73648. Versions of Safari prior to 7 are known to throw when
setting the value ""json"" as the response type. Other older browsers implementing the responseType.
Other browsers with infrequent update cycles may also be affected.

The json responseType value can be ignored if not supported, because JSON payloads are parsed on the

To migrate the code follow the example below:

Before:

scope: {
  myAttr: 'attribute',
  myBind: 'bind',
  myExpression: 'expression',
  myEval: 'evaluate',
  myAccessor: 'accessor'
}

After:

scope: {
  myAttr: '@',
  myBind: '@',
  myExpression: '&',
  // myEval - usually not useful, but in cases where the expression is assignable, you can use '='
  myAccessor: '=' // in directive's template change myAccessor() to myAccessor
}

The removed `inject` wasn't generaly useful for directives so there should be no code using it.

When we refactored , we broke the csp mode because the previous implementation
relied on the fact that it was ok to lazy initialize the .csp property, this
is not the case any more.

Besides, we need to know about csp mode during bootstrap and avoid injecting the
stylesheet when csp is active, so I refactored the code to fix both issues.

PR #4411 will follow up on this commit and add more improvements.

The new folder structure is organized around major packages that are expected to ship separately in some form.

`/isomorphic`

I moved classic/modern and children utils into a directory called ""isomorphic"" with the main export being ReactIsomorphic. This will eventually become the ""react"" package.

This includes all the dependencies that you might need to create a component without dependencies on the renderer/reconciler.

The rest moves into decoupled renderers.

`/renderers/dom/client` - This is the main renderer for DOM.

`/renderers/dom/server` - This is the server-side renderer for HTML strings.

`/addons` and `/test` - Same as before for now.

You're not supposed to take on a dependency inside another package.

Shared code is organized into a ""shared"" directory which is intended to support all the packages in that subdirectory. Meaning that once we swap to CommonJS modules, the only time you should use `..` is to target `../shared/` or `../../shared`.

E.g. `/shared/` is common utils that are used by everything.

`/renderers/shared/` is code that is shared by all renderers, such as the main reconciliation algorithm.

Shared code will likely be copied into each package rather than referenced. This allow us to have separate state and allow inlining and deadcode elimination.

Currently Angular monkey-patches a few jQuery methods that remove elements
from the DOM. Since methods like .remove() have multiple signatures
that can change what's actually removed, Angular needs to carefully
repeat them in its patching or it can break apps using jQuery correctly.
Such a strategy is also not future-safe.

Instead of patching individual methods on the prototype, it's better to
hook into jQuery.cleanData and trigger custom events there. This should be
safe as e.g. jQuery UI needs it and uses it. It'll also be future-safe.

The only drawback is that $destroy is no longer triggered when using $detach
but:

  1. Angular doesn't use this method, jqLite doesn't implement it.
  2. Detached elements can be re-attached keeping all their events & data
     so it makes sense that $destroy is not triggered on them.
  3. The approach from this commit is so much safer that any issues with
     .detach() working differently are outweighed by the robustness of the code.

BREAKING CHANGE: the $destroy event is no longer triggered when using the
jQuery detach() method. If you want to destroy Angular data attached to the

our build included invalid URLs to the production angular libraries.

This change runs a subset of the docs e2e tests directly against these

tests will fail and the CI build will abort, preventing the docs app from
being updated.

The data jQuery method was re-implemented in 2.0 in a secure way. This made
current hacky Angular solution to move data between elements via changing the
value of the internal node[jQuery.expando] stop working. Instead, just copy the
data from the first element to the other one.

Testing cache leaks on jQuery 2.x is not possible in the same way as it's done
in jqLite or in jQuery 1.x as there is no publicly exposed data storage. One
way to test it would be to intercept all places where a jQuery object is created
to save a reference to the underlaying node but there is no single place in the
jQuery code through which all element creation passes (there are various
shortcuts for performance reasons). Instead we rely on jqLite.cache testing
to find potential data leaks.

BREAKING CHANGE: Angular no longer supports jQuery versions below 2.1.1.

This diff enables setState to accept a function in addition to a state partial. If you provide a function, it will be called with the up-to-date `state, props, context` as arguments.

This enables some nicer syntax for complex setState patterns:

If setState is doing an increment and wants to guarantee atomicy, you need a function:

```
this.setState(state => ({ number: state.number + 1 }));
```

This atomicy is particularly important if setState is called multiple times in a single frame of execution as the result of complex user actions. It's a tricky bug to chase down and difficult to determine how to fix when you find it. The current pattern of reaching into _pendingState relies on an implementation detail.

In this example: props.doAction() may result in your ancestor re-rendering and providing you with new props. If setState is called directly with an object literal referencing `this.props`, it will use the *old* version of props, not the new value. Using a function solves for this case:

```
this.props.doAction();
this.setState((state, props) => ({ number: state.number * props.multiplier }));
```

The demo of the hash-bang vs html5-mode deep links was broken since the introduction
of a check for previously bootstrapped elements. See this commit: 3ee744cc63

We fix this problem by applying a null for the injector value of the element of the
at the root of the sub-app.
It also turns out that it was not necessary, and if fact broke the demo, to replace
the $document service for the sub-app.  This was because the $compile service calls
`$document.createElement()`, which doesn't exist on a `div`.
Finally, the bootstrap CSS was limiting the width of the ngAddress bar input box,
which made it difficult to see the changing URLs.

Objects received from outside AngularJS may have had their `hasOwnProperty`
method overridden with something else. In cases where we can do this without
incurring a performance penalty we call directly on Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
to ensure that we use the correct method.

Also, we have some internal hash objects, where the keys for the map are provided
from outside AngularJS. In such cases we either prevent `hasOwnProperty` from
being used as a key or provide some other way of preventing our objects from
having their `hasOwnProperty` overridden.

BREAKING CHANGE: Inputs with name equal to ""hasOwnProperty"" are not allowed inside
form or ngForm directives.

Before, inputs whose name was ""hasOwnProperty"" were quietly ignored and not added
to the scope.  Now a badname exception is thrown.

Using ""hasOwnProperty"" for an input name would be very unusual and bad practice.
Either do not include such an input in a `form` or `ngForm` directive or change
the name of the input.

We have less dynamic arrays in the code base now so let's start warning for all

I use the displayName to point out which component's render method was

different component (and passed as a property) I also show the owner of the
child. Maybe it should've attached the key at a higher level.

This does give false positives for arrays that are truly static. Those should
probably be refactored to use the XML syntax if possible.

98528be311b48269ba0e15ba4e3e2ad9b89693a9,angular/angular.js,1448403054,0,2015-11-24 22:10:54 UTC,"feat($resource): add proper support for cancelling requests

Introduced changes:

- Deprecate passing a promise as `timeout` (for `$resource` actions).
  It never worked correctly anyway.
  Now a warning is logged (using `$log.debug()`) and the property is
  removed.
- Add support for a boolean `cancellable` property in actions'
  configuration, the `$resource` factory's `options` parameter and the
  `$resourceProvider`'s `defaults` property.
  If true, the `$cancelRequest` method (added to all returned values for
  non-instance calls) will abort the request (if it's not already
  completed or aborted).
  If there is a numeric `timeout` specified on the action's configuration,
  the value of `cancellable` will be ignored.

Example usage:

```js
var Post = $resource('/posts/:id', {id: '@id'}, {
  get: {
    method: 'GET',
    cancellable: true
  }
});

var currentPost = Post.get({id: 1});
...
// A moment later the user selects another post, so
// we don't need the previous request any more
currentPost.$cancelRequest();
currentPost = Post.get({id: 2});
...
```

BREAKING CHANGE:

Using a promise as `timeout` is no longer supported and will log a
warning. It never worked the way it was supposed to anyway.

Before:

```js
var deferred = $q.defer();
var User = $resource('/api/user/:id', {id: '@id'}, {
  get: {method: 'GET', timeout: deferred.promise}
});

var user = User.get({id: 1});   // sends a request
deferred.resolve();             // aborts the request

// Now, we need to re-define `User` passing a new promise as `timeout`
// or else all subsequent requests from `someAction` will be aborted
User = $resource(...);
user = User.get({id: 2});
```

After:

```js
var User = $resource('/api/user/:id', {id: '@id'}, {
  get: {method: 'GET', cancellable: true}
});

var user = User.get({id: 1});   // sends a request
instance.$cancelRequest();      // aborts the request

user = User.get({id: 2});
```

This diff introduces PropType.shape which lets you type an object. PropType.object was already defined and since it isn't a function I couldn't really overload the meaning to also accept a type list. Instead of doing hackery, I decided to name it `shape`.

An example where this could be used is style:

When events are captured, the nearest React-rendered ancestor is found and events are propagated to its tree. This causes issues when components are nested as only the innermost component receives the events.

This change modifies this behaviour so events propagate all the way up the DOM hierarchy. To reduce the performance cost, this DOM traversal is only done if the component is actually nested (determined by the `containerIsNested` map which is lazily initialised).

By default, any change to an input will trigger an immediate model update,
form validation and run a $digest. This is not always desirable, especially
when you have a large number of bindings to update.

This PR implements a new directive `ngModelOptions`, which allow you to
override this default behavior in several ways. It is implemented as an
attribute, to which you pass an Angular expression, which evaluates to an
**options** object.

All inputs, using ngModel, will search for this directive in their ancestors
and use it if found.  This makes it easy to provide options for a whole
form or even the whole page, as well as specifying exceptions for
individual inputs.

* You can specify what events trigger an update to the model by providing
  an `updateOn` property on the **options** object. This property takes a
  string containing a space separated list of events.

  For example, `ng-model-options=""{ updateOn: 'blur' }""` will update the
  model only after the input loses focus.

  There is a special pseudo-event, called ""default"", which maps to the
  default event used by the input box normally. This is useful if you
  want to keep the default behavior and just add new events.

* You can specify a debounce delay, how long to wait after the last triggering
  event before updating the model, by providing a `debounce` property on
  the **options** object.

  This property can be a simple number, the
  debounce delay for all events. For example,
  `ng-model-options=""{ debounce: 500 }"" will ensure the model is updated
  only when there has been a period 500ms since the last triggering event.

  The property can also be an object, where the keys map to events and
  the values are a corresponding debounce delay for that event.
  This can be useful to force immediate updates on some specific
  circumstances (like blur events). For example,
  `ng-model-options=""{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: { default: 500, blur: 0} }""`

This commit also brings to an end one of the longest running Pull Requests
in the history of AngularJS (#2129)!  A testament to the patience of @lrlopez.

Previously we would clean up npm-shrinkwarp.json file in order to achieve serialization
stability, which would then allow us to create human readable diffs that allow code reviews
of npm-shrinkwrap to be meaningful.

This cleanup process does have an impact on the functionality of npm which was only recently
discovered by Vojta, when we tried to update to new Karma version. See: Automattic/engine.io-client#370

According to Julie, the root cause of these issues is npm/npm/#3581.

The workaround implemented in this commit is not to interfere with npm-shrinkwrap.json file, but instead
preserve the cleaned up version of its content in npm-shrinkwrap.clean.json which can then be used to
produce human readable diffs for code reviews of npm dependency updates.

In older Android browsers, `undefined` does not act like `0` in some
arithmetic operations. This leads to dates being formatted with `NaN`
strings in the dateFilter because the implementation of the `dateGetter`
function allows offset to be an optional parameter.
The fix is to convert offset to 0 if it is undefined.

Recently we changed the priority of attribute interpolation directive to -100
to ensure that it executes early in the post linking phase. This causes issues
with when terminal directives are placed on elements with attribute bindings
because the terminal directive will usually have 0 or higher priority which
results in attr interpolation directive not being applied to the element.

To fix this issue I'm switching the priority back to 100 and making moving the
binding setup into the pre-linking function.

This means that:

- terminal directives with priority lower than 100 will not affect the attribute
  binding
- if a directive wants to add or alter bindings it can do so in the pre-linking
  phase, as long as the priority of this directive is more than 100
- all post-linking functions will execute after the attribute binding has been
  set up
- all pre-linking functions with directive priority lower than 100 will execute
  after the attribute bindings have been setup

BREAKING CHANGE: the attribute interpolation (binding) executes as a directive
with priority 100 and the binding is set up in the pre-linking phase. It used
to be that the priority was -100 in rc.2 (100 before rc.2) and that the binding
was setup in the post-linking phase.

In IE the model is not updated when the input value is modified using the context
menu, e.g. pasting from the clipboard, or cutting all or part of the current value.
To capture these changes, we bind to the proprietary 'paste' and 'cut' events.

parseKeyValue and toKeyValue can now handle duplicate values in the query.
```
?x=1&x=2 <-> {x:[1,2]}
```

The algorithm looks like:
    1)parseKeyValue looks for presence of obj[key]
    2)detects and replaces obj[key] with [obj[key],val]
    3)then pushes more duplicates if necessary
    4)toKeyValue decodes array correctly
    5)(not changed)$location.search({param: 'key'}) still replaces if necessary
    6)(not changed)$location.search({param: ['key1', 'key2']}) sets the url with duplicates

BREAKING CHANGE: Before this change:
- `parseKeyValue` only took the last key overwriting all the previous keys;
- `toKeyValue` joined the keys together in a comma delimited string.
This was deemed buggy behavior. If your server relied on this behavior
then either the server should be fixed or a simple serialization of
the array should be done on the client before passing it to $location.

For controlled inputs, `updateWrapper` was getting called before the
`type` prop had a chance to update. This could lead to a case where
switching from the `text` to `number` type caused a validation error
that would prevent the proper input value from being assigned.

This commit moves the call to `ReactDOMInput.updateWrapper` below
`_updateProperties` to avoid this situation."

Do not trim input[type=password] values

Previously, input[type=password] would trim values by default, and would require an explicit ng-trim=""false""

never trim the password value.

All attributes defined on SVG elements will now be passed directly regardless of the whitelist. The casing specified by user will be preserved, and setAttribute() will be used.

In the future we will remove support for the camel case aliases to the hyphenated attributes. For example, we currently map `strokeWidth` to `stroke-width` but this is now deprecated behind a warning. When we remove support for this we can remove some of the code paths introduced in this commit.

The purpose of this change is to stop maintaining a separate SVG property config. The config still exists for two purposes:

* Allow a migration path for deprecated camelcased versions of hyphenated SVG attributes
* Track special namespaced attributes (they still require a whitelist)

However it is no longer a blocker for using new non-namespaced SVG attributes, and users don't have to ask us to add them to the whitelist.

This change brings Angular's JSONP behaviour closer in line with jQuery's. It will no longer treat
a callback called with no data as an error, and will no longer support IE8 via the onreadystatechanged
event.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Previously, the JSONP backend code would support IE8 by relying on the readystatechanged events. This
is no longer the case, as these events do not provide adequate useful information for deeming whether
or not a response is an error.

Previously, a JSONP response which did not pass data into the callback would be given a status of -2,
and treated as an error. Now, this situation will instead be given a status of 200, despite the lack
of data. This is useful for interaction with certain APIs.

Previously, the onload and onerror callbacks were added to the JSONP script tag. These have been
replaced with jQuery events, in order to gain access to the event object. This means that it is now
difficult to test if the callbacks are registered or not. This is possible with jQuery, using the
$.data(""events"") method, however it is currently impossible with jqLite. This is not expected to
break applications.

Starting with 88bb551, `ngMock` will attach the `$injector` to the `$rootElement`, but will never
clean it up, resulting in a memory leak. Since a new `$rootElement` is created for every test,
this leak causes Karma to crash on large test-suites.
The problem was not detected by our internal tests, because we do our own clean-up in
`testabilityPatch.js`.

88bb551 was revert with 1b8590a.
This commit incorporates the changes from 88bb551 and prevents the memory leak, by cleaning up all
data attached to `$rootElement` after each test.

This makes the two interpolation errors consistent and avoids checking the same thing per link
(which previously would log the same error per link).
The test changes are not necessary but do make them stricter and more like the selmulti error tests.

Closes #13267

BREAKING CHANGE:

Using interpolation in any on* event attributes (e.g. `<button onclick=""{{myVar}}"">`) will now throw
the ""nodomevents"" error at compile time.
Previously the nodomevents was thrown at link time. The new behavior makes it consistent with
the ""selmulti"" error.
The breaking change should be rare, as it relates to incorrect API use that should not make it to
production apps in the first place.

This commit tried to create consistency by ensuring that `$isEmpty` is not
called on both model and view values but it chose to only use `$modelValue`,
which is not actually correct.

`$isEmpty` is designed to compute whether the `$viewValue` is empty. In
practice this is the only part of the parse/format system that the
directive has control over. We can't rely on the `$modelValue` being in
any particular format since other directives can add in their own formatters
and parsers to completely change this.

So far Angular have used the toBoolean function to decide if the parsed value
is truthy. The function made more values falsy than regular JavaScript would,
e.g. strings 'f' and 'no' were both treated as falsy. This creates suble bugs
when backend sends a non-empty string with one of these values and something
suddenly hides in the application

Thanks to lgalfaso for test ideas.

BREAKING CHANGE: values 'f', '0', 'false', 'no', 'n', '[]' are no longer
treated as falsy. Only JavaScript falsy values are now treated as falsy by the
expression parser; there are six of them: false, null, undefined, NaN, 0 and """".

Array.prototype.sort is speced out to be as potentionally unstable sort,
which is how it's implemented in FF and IE. This has caused the order
of directives with the same priority to vary between browsers.

For consistency sake, we now consider directive name and registration,
order when determining the order of directives with the same priority.

Note: it is still possible to get into a situation when the directive
order is underministic - when source files are loaded asynchronously
in non-deterministic order and there are are directives registered
with the same name and priority, the order in which they will be applied
will depend on the file load order.

The leak can occur when ngSwich is used inside ngRepeat or any other
directive which is destroyed while its transcluded content (which
includes ngSwitch) is not attached to the DOM.

Refactor ngSwitch to use controller instead of storing data on compile
node. This means that we don't need to clean up the jq data cache.
Controller reference is released when the linking fn is released.

This corrects a complicated compiler issue, described in detail below:

Previously, if an element transclusion directive contained an asynchronous directive whose template
contained another element transclusion directive, the inner element transclusion directive would be
linked with the element, rather than the expected comment node.

An example manifestation of this bug would look like so:

```html
<div ng-repeat=""i in [1,2,3,4,5]"">
  <div my-directive>
  </div>
</div>
```

`my-directive` would be a replace directive, and its template would contain another element
transclusion directive, like so:

```html
<div ng-if=""true"">{{i}}</div>
```

ngIf would be linked with this template content, rather than the comment node, and the template element
would be attached to the DOM, rather than the comment. As a result, this caused ng-if to duplicate the
template when its expression evaluated to true.

Test Plan:
- Open two tabs: reactjs.com and localhost:4000/react
- Click around on reactjs.com to prime the cache with the fonts
- Switch tabs and click around on localhost (but do not force refresh!)
- Now you get custom fonts loaded locally and it doesn't jump when you change tabs

Fixes #3473

I tag each React element with `$$typeof: Symbol.for('react.element')`. We need
this to be able to safely distinguish these from plain objects that might have
come from user provided JSON.

The idiomatic JavaScript way of tagging an object is for it to inherent some
prototype and then use `instanceof` to test for it.

However, this has limitations since it doesn't work with value types which
require `typeof` checks. They also don't work across realms. Which is why there
are alternative tag checks like `Array.isArray` or the `toStringTag`. Another
problem is that different instances of React that might have been created not knowing about eachother. npm tends to make this kind of problem occur a lot.

Additionally, it is our hope that ReactElement will one day be specified in
terms of a ""Value Type"" style record instead of a plain Object.

This Value Types proposal by @nikomatsakis is currently on hold but does satisfy all these requirements:

https://github.com/nikomatsakis/typed-objects-explainer/blob/master/valuetypes.md#the-typeof-operator

Additionally, there is already a system for coordinating tags across module
systems and even realms in ES6. Namely using `Symbol.for`.

Currently these objects are not able to transfer between Workers but there is
nothing preventing that from being possible in the future. You could imagine
even `Symbol.for` working across Worker boundaries. You could also build a
system that coordinates Symbols and Value Types from server to client or through
serialized forms. That's beyond the scope of React itself, and if it was built
it seems like it would belong with the `Symbol` system. A system could override
the `Symbol.for('react.element')` to return a plain yet
cryptographically random or unique number. That would allow ReactElements to
pass through JSON without risking the XSS issue.

The fallback solution is a plain well-known number. This makes it unsafe with
regard to the XSS issue described in #3473. We could have used a much more
convoluted solution to protect against JSON specifically but that would require
some kind of significant coordination, or change the check to do a
`typeof element.$$typeof === 'function'` check which would not make it unique to
React. It seems cleaner to just use a fixed number since the protection is just
a secondary layer anyway. I'm not sure if this is the right tradeoff.

In short, if you want the XSS protection, use a proper Symbol polyfill.

Finally, the reason for calling it `$$typeof` is to avoid confusion with `.type`
and the use case is to add a tag that the `typeof` operator would refer to.
I would use `@@typeof` but that seems to deopt in JSC. I also don't use
`__typeof` because this is more than a framework private. It should really be
part of the polyfilling layer.

When $timeout#flush is called with a delay and no task can be flushed within that
delay, the current time should not be updated as that gets the mock into an inconsistent
state.

BREAKING CHANGE: if a tests was written around the buggy behavior the delays might be off now

This would typically not be a problem, but because of the previous breaking change in
$timeout.flush, the combination of two might be confusing and that's why we are documenting
it.

Old behavior:

```
doSomething(); //schedules task to execute in 500ms from now
doOtherStuff(); //schedules task to execute in 600ms from now

try {
  $timeout.flush(300); // throws ""no task to be flushed"" exception
} catch(e) {};
$time.flush(200); //flushes only doSomething() task
```

New behavior:

```
doSomething(); //schedules task to execute in 500ms from now
doOtherStuff(); //schedules task to execute in 600ms from now

try {
  $timeout.flush(300); // throws ""no task to be flushed"" exception
} catch(e) {};
$time.flush(200); // throws ""no task to be flushed"" exception again
                  // because previous exception didn't move the time forward
```

Fixed test:

```
doSomething(); //schedules task to execute in 500ms from now
doOtherStuff(); //schedules task to execute in 600ms from now

try {
  $timeout.flush(300); // throws ""no task to be flushed"" exception
} catch(e) {};
$time.flush(500); // flushes only doSomething() task

`ReactDebugTool` used to only call `purgeUnmountedComponents()` while profiling, so information about unmounted instances kept accumulating when not profiling.

Additionally, unmounting in React Native and rendering to string did not correctly clean up the devtool.

Finally, the tests tested the wrong behavior and relied on explicit `purgeUnmountedComponent()` calls.

To fix this, we:

* Test specifically that unmounting is enough to clean up the tree devtool.
* Add missing `onBeginFlush` and `onEndFlush` calls to server and native rendering so `ReactDebugTool` knows when to copy the tree.

```js

the pipe would not be included in the parameter name.

Following this change, the presence of the pipe operator will typically cause an
exception to be thrown due to the fact that the generated regexp is invalid.

The net result of this change is that ? and * operators will not be masked, and
pipe operators will need to be removed, although it's unexpected that these are
being used anywhere.

Previously, the compiler would throw an error if a directive requested new non-isolate scope
after a directive had requested isolate scope. But it would not error if a directive
requested an isolate scope after a directive had requested a new non-isolate scope.

Since it is invalid to have more than one directive request any kind of scope if one of
them has requested isolate scope, then the compiler should error whatever order the
directives are applied.

This fix addresses this situation by throwing error regardless of order of directives.

BREAKING CHANGE:

Requesting isolate scope and any other scope on a single element is an error.
Before this change, the compiler let two directives request a child scope
and an isolate scope if the compiler applied them in the order of non-isolate
scope directive followed by isolate scope directive.

Now the compiler will error regardless of the order.

If you find that your code is now throwing a `$compile:multidir` error,
check that you do not have directives on the same element that are trying
to request both an isolate and a non-isolate scope and fix your code.

Due to a known V8 memory leak[1] we need to perform extra cleanup to make it easier
for GC to collect this scope object.

V8 leaks are due to strong references from optimized code (fixed in M34) and inline
caches (fix in works). Inline caches are caches that the virtual machine builds on the
fly to speed up property access for javascript objects. These caches contain strong
references to objects so under certain conditions this can create a leak.

The reason why these leaks are extra bad for Scope instances is that scopes hold on
to ton of stuff, so when a single scope leaks, it makes a ton of other stuff leak.

This change removes references to objects that might be holding other big
objects. This means that even if the destroyed scope leaks, the child scopes
should not leak because we are not explicitly holding onto them.

Additionally in  theory we should also help make the current scope eligible for GC
by changing properties of the current Scope object.

I was able to manually verify that this fixes the problem for the following
example app: http://plnkr.co/edit/FrSw6SCEVODk02Ljo8se

Given the nature of the problem I'm not 100% sure that this will work around
the V8 problem in scenarios common for Angular apps, but I guess it's better
than nothing.

This is a second attempt to enhance the cleanup, the first one failed  and was
reverted because it was too aggressive and caused problems for existing apps.

example app: http://plnkr.co/edit/FrSw6SCEVODk02Ljo8se?p=preview

Given the nature of the problem I'm not 100% sure that this will work around
the V8 problem in scenarios common for Angular apps, but I guess it's better
than nothing.

This PR is the first in a series of pull requests split from the new `ReactPerf` implementation in #6046.

Here, we introduce a new module called `ReactDebugInstanceMap`. It will be used in `__DEV__` and, when the `__PROFILE__` gate is added, in the `__PROFILE__` builds. It will *not* be used in the production builds.

This module acts as a mapping between “debug IDs” (a new concept) and the internal instances. Not to be confused with the existing `ReactInstanceMap` that maps internal instances to public instances.

What are the “debug IDs” and why do we need them? Both the new `ReactPerf` and other consumers of the devtool API, such as React DevTools, need access to some data from the internal instances, such as the instance type display name, current props and children, and so on. Right now we let such tools access internal instances directly but this hurts our ability to refactor their implementations and burdens React DevTools with undesired implementation details such as having to support React ART in a special way.[1]

The purpose of adding `ReactDebugInstanceMap` is to only expose “debug IDs” instead of the internal instances to any devtools. In a future RP, whenever there is an event such as mounting, updating, or unmounting a component, we will emit an event in `ReactDebugTool` with the debug ID of the instance. We will also add an introspection API that lets the consumer pass an ID and get the information about the current children, props, state, display name, and so on, without exposing the internal instances.

`ReactDebugInstanceMap` has a concept of “registering” an instance. We plan to add the hooks that register an instance as soon as it is created, and unregister it during unmounting. It will only be possible to read information about the instance while it is still registered. If we add support for reparenting, we should be able to move the (un)registration code to different places in the component lifecycle without changing this code. The currently registered instances are held in the `registeredInstancesByIDs` dictionary.

There is also a reverse lookup dictionary called `allInstancesToIDs` which maps instances back to their IDs. It is implemented as a `WeakMap` so the keys are stable and we’re not holding onto the unregistered instances. If we’re not happy with `WeakMap`, one possible alternative would be to add a new field called `_debugID` to all the internal instances, but we don’t want to do this in production. Using `WeakMap` seems like a simpler solution here (and stable IDs are a nice bonus). This, however, means that the `__DEV__` (and the future `__PROFILE__`) builds will only work in browsers that support our usage of `WeakMap`.

In the Android browser, the BFCache maintains
the state of JavaScript applications even when
navigating to another app, so that going
forward and back, to and from an application
is very fast.

Unfortunately, this can have undesired side
effects. In this instance, the location
variable was holding a reference to a stale
window.location, and was throwing errors
when going back to an Angular app after
browsing to another site.

This fix makes sure that location.url()
includes a check to make sure that location
is referencing the current window.location.

This change allows the developer to bind an isolate scope / controller property
to an expression, using a `<` binding, in such a way that if the value of the
expression changes, the scope/controller property is updated but not the
converse.

The binding is implemented as a single simple watch, which can also provide
performance benefits over two way bindings.

That behavior was helpful, and we did hit a case which was solved by this.
However, this pattern is extremely uncommon. I've yet to even find the
original case, let alone any existing cases in our codebase.

Therefore, we're dropping this to simplify elements and enable new
optimizations.

Prior to this fix, ngAnimate would always trigger animations even if
the browser tab or browser window was not visible. This would cause
issues with class updates / DOM operations even if elements were not

requestAnimationFrame when browser windows / tabs are not visible.

This fix disables animations if `document.hidden` is `true`.

Prior to this fix, the urlResolve method would automatically
strip the first segment of a path if the segment ends in a colon.
This was to correct undesired behavior in the $location service
using the file protocol on windows in multiple browsers (see #4680).

However, there could be cases where users intentionally 
have first path segments that end in a colon 
(although this conflicts with section 3.3 of rfc3986).

The solution to this problem is an extra check to make sure
the first path segment of the input url does not end with a colon,
to make sure we're only removing undesired path segments.

When ngOptions is present on a select, the option directive should not be able to
register options on the selectCtrl since this may cause errors during the
ngOptions lifecycle.

This can happen in the following cases:

- there is a blank option below the select element, an ngModel
directive, an ngOptions directive and some other directive on the select
element, which compiles the children of the select
(i.e. the option elements) before ngOptions is has finished linking.

- there is a blank option below the select element, an ngModel
directive, an ngOptions directive and another directive, which uses
templateUrl and replace:true.

What happens is:
- the option directive is compiled and adds an element `$destroy` listener
that will call `ngModel.$render` when the option element is removed.
- when `ngOptions` processes the option, it removes the element, and
triggers the `$destroy` listener on the option.
- the registered `$destroy` listener calls `$render` on `ngModel`.
- $render calls `selectCtrl.writeValue()`, which accesses the `options`
object in the `ngOptions` directive.
- Since `ngOptions` has not yet completed linking the `options` has not
yet been defined and we get an error.

This fix moves the registration code for the `option` directive into the
`SelectController.registerOption()` method, which is then overridden by
the `ngOptions` directive as a `noop`.

The problem was in keeping the values of `attrNameStart` and `attrNameEnd` between directive loop iterations which lead to the compiler looking for multi-element ranges for any directives that happened to be in the directive list after one that was applied on a range. For instance, having a ng-repeat-start and ng-class on a single element with ng-repeat being resolved first made the compiler look for an ng-repeat-end for both ng-repeat and ng-class because the `attrNameEnd` was not reset to a falsy value before the second iteration. As the result, an exception saying the block end element could not be found and the second directive was not actually applied.

Recent browsers, particularly PhantomJS 1.9.2 and Safari 7.0
treat the stack property as non-configurable and unwritable.

Because window.inject captures the stack at the time of the inject,
and attempts to insert it into a captured throw from the injected
function by modifying e.stack, a meaningless error message and
stack is thrown instead.

This commit inserts two tests exposing the problem, and implements
a proposed solution that builds a new error-like object that mimicks
the old Error object, but with the additional stack information, and
captures the toString function from the Error object prototype.  This
appears to work for the browsers suppoerted here."

The separator string used to split the view value into a list for the model
value is now used to join the list items back together again for the view value.

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `ngList` directive no longer supports splitting the view value
via a regular expression. We need to be able to re-join list items back
together and doing this when you can split with regular expressions can
lead to inconsistent behaviour and would be much more complex to support.

If your application relies upon ngList splitting with a regular expression
then you should either try to convert the separator to a simple string or
you can implement your own version of this directive for you application.

Upgrade `TextChangeEventPlugin` to be the `onChange` event that React
fires. In React, `onChange` will now fire when `input` fires for form elements in
modern browsers.

Handle this for:

  input[type=text]
  input[type=password]
  input[type=checkbox]
  input[type=radio]
  textarea
  select

Support:

- OSX Chrome
- OSX Safari
- OSX Firefox
- Win 7 / IE8
- Win 7 / IE9
- Win 7 / IE10

Everything works but caret selection / placement differs from browser to
browser.

For <select> elements, the event is fired with `change`. This is a
conscious decision, even though in some browsers (OSX firefox, IE), it
can be argued that the event should fire more due to how the UI looks.

Builds on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/75, which handled only
text inputs.

In HTML5 mode, links can now be selectively rewritten, by setting `mode.rewriteLinks` to a string

This can be useful in situations where it is desirable to use HTML5 mode without a `<base>` tag, but
still support rewriting specific links only. See #14959 for more details on a possible usecase.

(https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto), which is implemented in Go and
does not support lookaheads or backreferences in regular expressions.
(Unfortunately that *does* mean that otto isn't fully compatible with
the ECMA5 spec; but since this is the only lookahead I am aware of in
the React codebase, this change makes React once again compatible with
otto, and any other JS implementation that may not be fully compliant on
regular expressions).

As far as I can tell, the previous code replaced a sequence of slash
characters with one more slash than before. The new code avoids the
negative lookahead by matching any sequence of slash characters and then
using the special `$&` placeholder to replace the matched sequence with
the original sequence, plus one more slash.

Jordan warned (and StackOverflow confirmed) that IE8 doesn't respect HTML
comment nodes when setting `.innerHTML`:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15006001/inserting-a-comment-in-innerhtml

The virtue of the comment strategy was that the parser did all the work of
maintaining the boundaries between markup chunks, using comments as the
boundary markers.  The new strategy (of tagging the first node with a
special attribute) has a similar virtue, since the parser should preserve
that attribute only for the nodes we care about, and any rendered nodes
that do not have the attribute can be ignored (and complained about by
`console.error`).

Thanks to @cironunes for the initial implementation in https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/9715

Adds support for binding to input[range] with the following behavior / features:

- Like input[number], it requires the model to be a Number, and will set the model to a Number
- it supports setting the min/max values via the min/max and ngMin/ngMax attributes
- it follows the browser behavior of never allowing an invalid value. That means, when the browser
converts an invalid value (empty: null, undefined, false ..., out of bounds: greater than max, less than min)
to a valid value, the input will in turn set the model to this new valid value via $setViewValue.
-- this means a range input will never be required and never have a non-Number model value, once the
ngModel directive is initialized.
-- this behavior is supported when the model changes and when the min/max attributes change in a way
that prompts the browser to update the input value.
-- ngMin / ngMax do not prompt the browser to update the values, as they don't set the attribute values.
Instead, they will set the min / max errors when appropriate
- browsers that do not support input[range] (IE9) handle the input like a number input (with validation etc.)

How did compiling a templateUrl (async) directive with `replace:true` work before this commit?
1/ apply all directives with higher priority than the templateUrl directive
2/ partially apply the templateUrl directive (create `beforeTemplateNodeLinkFn`)
3/ fetch the template
4/ apply second part of the templateUrl directive on the fetched template
(`afterTemplateNodeLinkFn`)

That is, the templateUrl directive is basically split into two parts (two `nodeLinkFn` functions),
which has to be both applied.

Normally we compose linking functions (`nodeLinkFn`) using continuation - calling the linking
function of a parent element, passing the linking function of the child elements as an argument. The
parent linking function then does:
1/ execute its pre-link functions
2/ call the child elements linking function (traverse)
3/ execute its post-link functions

Now, we have two linking functions for the same DOM element level (because the templateUrl directive
has been split).

There has been multiple issues because of the order of these two linking functions (creating
controller before setting up scope locals, running linking functions before instantiating
controller, etc.). It is easy to fix one use case, but it breaks some other use case. It is hard to
decide what is the ""correct"" order of these two linking functions as they are essentially on the
same level.

Running them side-by-side screws up pre/post linking functions for the high priority directives
(those executed before the templateUrl directive). It runs post-linking functions before traversing:
```js
beforeTemplateNodeLinkFn(null); // do not travers
afterTemplateNodeLinkFn(afterTemplateChildLinkFn);
```

Composing them (in any order) screws up the order of post-linking functions. We could fix this by
having post-linking functions to execute in reverse order (from the lowest priority to the highest)
which might actually make a sense.

**My solution is to remove this splitting.** This commit removes the `beforeTemplateNodeLinkFn`. The
first run (before we have the template) only schedules fetching the template. The rest (creating
scope locals, instantiating a controller, linking functions, etc) is done when processing the
directive again (in the context of the already fetched template; this is the cloned
`derivedSyncDirective`).

We still need to pass-through the linking functions of the higher priority directives (those
executed before the templateUrl directive), that's why I added `preLinkFns` and `postLinkFns`
arguments to `applyDirectivesToNode`.

This also changes the ""$compile transclude should make the result of a transclusion available to the
parent directive in post- linking phase (templateUrl)"" unit test. It was testing that a parent
directive can see the content of transclusion in its pre-link function. That is IMHO wrong (as the
`ngTransclude` directive inserts the translusion in its linking function). This test was only passing because of
c173ca412878d537b18df01f39e400ea48a4b398, which changed the behavior of the compiler to traverse
before executing the parent linking function. That was wrong and also caused the #3792 issue, which
this change fixes.

7a668cdd7d08a7016883eb3c671cbcd586223ae8,angular/angular.js,1449411219,0,2015-12-06 14:13:39 UTC,"fix($sanitize): blacklist SVG `<use>` elements

The use element can reference external svg's (same origin) and can include
xlink javascript urls or foreign object that can execute xss.

This change disallows `<use>` elements in sanitized SVG markup.

An example of a malicious SVG document would be:

SVG to sanitize:
```
<svg><use xlink:href=""test.svg#xss"" /></svg>
```

External SVG file (test.svg)
```
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" standalone=""no""?>
<svg xmlns:svg=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg""
   xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" width=""100""
   height=""100""
   id=""xss"">
<a xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""javascript:alert(1)"">
  <circle cx=""50"" cy=""50"" r=""40"" stroke=""black"" stroke-width=""3"" fill=""red"" />
</a>
</svg>
```

Here the SVG to sanitize loads in the `test.svg` file via the `<use>` element.
The sanitizer is not able to parse this file, which contains malicious
executable mark-up.

This can only be taken advantage of if the external file is available via the
same origin restrictions in place.

Closes #13453

BREAKING CHANGE:

The `<use>` element is now removed from SVG passed to the `$sanitize` service.

This element is only used to import external SVG resources, which is a security
risk as the `$sanitize` service does not have access to the resource in order
to sanitize it.

Browsers that natively support the `textInput` event appear to have a bug: when preventing default behavior for a `textInput` event occurring for a spacebar keypress, the character is prevented from being inserted **but the browser scrolls down**.

Minimal repro example: http://jsfiddle.net/salier/bX4fw/

This is ridiculous, since scrolling makes no sense when the user is focused in a textinput or contenteditable. Preventing default at the `textInput` stage should mean to prevent the character from being inserted, and should have no impact at all on scrolling behavior. I have filed this as a Chromium bug (https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=355103) but I'm not going to hold out much hope that they'll fix it.

To resolve this, I'm special-casing the spacebar character at the plugin level, in `BeforeInputEventPlugin`. I looked for ways to do this at the component level, but it seems to me that this is simply a browser bug and it's cleaner to handle it there.

In browsers that can use the native `textInput` event, I'm checking the code of the pressed key. If it's the spacebar, we dispatch the synthetic event as if there were no native `textInput` event -- as if we were running Firefox. Then, if the synthetic event is not canceled and we make it through to the native `textInput` event, bail if the character data is a space character.

In Firefox, hovering over an option in an open select menu updates the selected property of option
elements. This means that when a render is triggered by the digest cycle, and the list of options
is being rendered, the selected properties are reset to the values from the model and the option
hovered over changes. This fix changes the code to only use DOM elements' selected properties in a
comparison when a change event has been fired. Otherwise, the internal new and existing option
arrays are used.

lunr has been responsible for slowdown in our test suite by adding ~1sec per
end-to-end test.

(this is because it initializes the index when the app starts)

since out test suite primarily tests the examples, it's reasonable do disable
the search as a temporary meansure.

the real fix is to use protractor and extract all of the examples into
standalone apps which can be tested without bootstrapping the whole docs app.

Not removing them resulted in leaks as we would hold on to removed nodes forever.

This really showed up with images and the load event where we would unmount and create a new img with the same react id as the old one. We properly cleared and primed the caches but we would handle the load event for both nodes. We would eventually hit an invariant in that path as we tried to handle the event for the removed node, which no longer matched the node we had in the cache.

By forcefully removing the listener, we'll avoid this problem entirely and we should leak fewer DOM nodes.

If the values collection is array-like then we only display the options that

BREAKING CHANGE:
`ngOptions` will now throw if `ngModel` is not present on the `select`

fail, which could lead to hard to debug errors. The change should
therefore not affect any applications, as it simply makes the
requirement more strict and alerts the developer explicitly.

Currently, when the location provider is set to html5 mode, all links

desirable behavior in some cases (such as using ngRoute), not all cases

One example would be an application using the

the router use the `ui-sref` directive, so the rewrite behavior is

$animate will cache subsequent calls to GCS in the event that the element
with the same CSS classes and the same parentNode is being animated. Once the
animation is started then $animate waits for one rAF before flushing the GCS
lookup cache. Prior to this fix, if GCS was unable to detect any transitions
or keyframes on the element then it would simply close the animation, but it
would not trigger the rAF code to flush the cache. This issue caused a bug
which made it difficult to detect why certain animations are not allowed to
fire if the element didn't contain any CSS-based animations beforehand.

previously the compile/link fns executed in this order controlled via priority:

- CompilePriorityHigh, CompilePriorityMedium, CompilePriorityLow
- PreLinkPriorityHigh, PreLinkPriorityMedium, PreLinkPriorityLow
- link children
- PostLinkPriorityHigh, PostLinkPriorityMedium, PostLinkPriorityLow

This was changed to:

- CompilePriorityHigh, CompilePriorityMedium, CompilePriorityLow
- PreLinkPriorityHigh, PreLinkPriorityMedium, PreLinkPriorityLow
- link children
- PostLinkPriorityLow, PostLinkPriorityMedium , PostLinkPriorityHigh

Using this order the child transclusion directive that gets replaced
onto the current element get executed correctly (see issue #3558),
and more generally, the order of execution of post linking function
makes more sense. The incorrect order was an oversight that has
gone unnoticed for many suns and moons.

(FYI: postLink functions are the default linking functions)

BREAKING CHANGE: the order of postLink fn is now mirror opposite of
the order in which corresponding preLinking and compile functions
execute.

Very few directives in practice rely on order of postLinking function
(unlike on the order of compile functions), so in the rare case
of this change affecting an existing directive, it might be necessary
to convert it to a preLinking function or give it negative priority
(look at the diff of this commit to see how an internal attribute
interpolation directive was adjusted).

change, the expression will be evaluated.

This change speeds up simple expressions like `firstName | noop` by ~15%
and more complex expressions like `startDate | date` by ~2500%.

BREAKING CHANGE: all filters are assumed to be stateless functions

Previously it was a good practice to make all filters stateless, but now
it's a requirement in order for the model change-observation to pick up
all changes.

If an existing filter is statefull, it can be flagged as such but keep in
mind that this will result in a significant performance-penalty (or rather
lost opportunity to benefit from a major perf improvement) that will
affect the $digest duration.

To flag a filter as stateful do the following:

myApp.filter('myFilter', function() {
  function myFilter(input) { ... };
  myFilter.$stateful = true;
  return myFilter;
});

Previously non-object literals would be thrown out of Resource responses with isArray===true, or
otherwise converted into Objects (in the case of string literals). The reason for this is because
shallowClearAndCopy iterates over keys, and copies keys into the destination. Iterating over String
keys results in integer keys, with a single-character value.

Not converting non-objects to Resources means that you lose the ability to perform Resource operations
on them. However, they become usable as strings, numbers, or booleans, which is important.

In the future, it would be useful to make these useful as Resources while still retaining their primitive
value usefulness.

Summary:
adds `this.context` which you can think of as implicit props, which are passed automatically down the //ownership// hierarchy.

Contexts should be used sparingly, since they essentially allow components to communicate with descendants (in the ownership sense, not parenthood sense), which is not usually a good idea. You probably would only use contexts in places where you'd normally use a global, but contexts allow you to override them for certain view subtrees which you can't do with globals.

The context starts out `null`:

  var RootComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      // this.context === null
    }
  });

You should **never** mutate the context directly, just like props and state.

You can change the context of your children (the ones you own, not `this.props.children` or via other props) using the new `withContext` method on `React`:

  var RootComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      // this.context === null
      var children = React.withContext({foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}, () => (
        // In ChildComponent#render, this.context === {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}
        <ChildComponent />
      ));
      // this.context === null
    }
  });

Contexts are merged, so a component can override its owner's context **for its children**:

  var ChildComponent = React.createClass({
    render: function() {
      // this.context === {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'} (for the caller above)
      var children = React.withContext({foo: 'c'},() => (
        // In GrandchildComponent#render,
        // this.context === {foo: 'c', bar: 'b'}
        <GrandchildComponent />
      ));
      // this.context === {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}
    }
  });

This creates a membrane around the React component prototype. It warns if you

The workaround, for unknown types, is to access the constructor using
component.type which has static methods on it.

This also has the benefit of simplifying what parameters need to be passed

Instead of putting the shared code in a base class method, we use a wrapper
call around all invokations. That way they're free to add code before AND
after the non-shared code.

That way we ensure that component extensions don't need to implement
ReactComponentMixin and do super() calls into it. This helps to create a
tighter API for custom component extensions.

This provides the first step towards moving these methods to static
methods which allows to use a different dispatch mechanism instead of
virtual method calls. E.g. pattern matching.

3660fd0912d3ccf6def8c9f02d8d4c0621c8d91f,angular/angular.js,1409197558,-420,2014-08-28 03:45:58 UTC,"feat($compile/ngBind): allow disabling binding info

The compiler and ngBind directives add binding information (`ng-binding`
CSS class and `$binding` data property) to elements when they are bound to
the scope. This is only to aid testing and debugging for tools such as
Protractor and Batarang. In production this is unnecessary and add a
performance penalty.

This can be now disabled by calling `$compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false)`
in a module `config` block:
```
someModule.config(['$compileProvider', function($compileProvider) {
  $compileProvider.debugInfoEnabled(false);
}]);
```

In the bench/apps/largetable-bp benchmark this change, with debug info disabled,
improved by ~140ms, that is 10%.
Measuring the ""create"" phase, 25 loops, mean time ~1340ms -> ~1200ms.

We were storing the whole `interpolationFn` in the `$binding` data on
elements but this function was bringing a lot of closure variables with it
and so was consuming unwanted amounts of memory.

Now we are only storing the parsed interpolation expressions from the
binding (i.e. the values of `interpolationFn.expressions`).

BREAKING CHANGE:
The value of `$binding` data property on an element is always an array now
and the expressions do not include the curly braces `{{ ... }}`.

Bind-once will have no effect when directily invoking `parseFn` (i.e. `parseFn()`)

**Limit size of local-part and total path size in eMail addresses**

RFC 5321 §4.5.3.1.1 ⇒ local-part can have up to 64 octets
RFC 5321 §4.5.3.1.3 ⇒ path “including the punctuation and
element separators” can have up to 256 octets
RFC 5321 §4.1.2 specifies path as ‘<’ + mailbox¹ + ‘>’ in
the best case, leaving us 254 octets

The limitation of the total path size to 254 octets leaves
at most 252 octets (one local-part, one ‘@’) for the domain,
which means we don’t need to explicitly check the domain
size any more (removing the assertion after the ‘@’).

① RFC 821/5321 “mailbox” is the same as RFC 822 “addr-spec”

**Optimise eMail address regex for speed**

There is no need to make it case-insensitive; the local-part
already catches the entire range, and the host part is easily

**Limit eMail address total host part length**

RFC 1035 §2.3.4 imposes a maximum length for any DNS object;
RFC 5321 §2.3.5 references this (and requires FQDNs, but there
have been cases where a TLD had an MX RR and thus eMail addresses
like “localpart@tld” are valid).

**Limit eMail address individual host part length**

A “label” (each of the things between the dots (‘.’) after the ‘@’ in
the eMail address) MUST NOT be longer than 63 characters.

cf. http://www.mirbsd.org/cvs.cgi/contrib/hosted/tg/mailfrom.php?rev=HEAD

**Fix eMail address local-part validation**

$animate attempts places a `transition: none 0s` block on the element when
the first CSS class is applied if a transition animation is underway. This
works fine for structural animations (enter, leave and move), however, for
class-based animations, this poses a big problem. As of this patch, instead
of $animate placing the block, it is now the responsibility of the user to
place `transition: 0s none` into their class-based transition setup CSS class.
This way the animation will avoid all snapping and any will allow $animate to
play nicely with class-based transitions that are defined outside of ngAnimate.

Closes #6674
Closes #6739

BREAKING CHANGE: Any class-based animation code that makes use of transitions
and uses the setup CSS classes (such as class-add and class-remove) must now
provide a empty transition value to ensure that its styling is applied right
away. In other words if your animation code is expecting any styling to be
applied that is defined in the setup class then it will not be applied
""instantly"" default unless a `transition:0s none` value is present in the styling
for that CSS class. This situation is only the case if a transition is already
present on the base CSS class once the animation kicks off.

Prior to this fix when an Angular application is bootstrapped it would only
place an animation guard to prevent animations from running when the application
starts for the first two digest cycles. However, if any controllers or directives,
that are executed upon boostrap, trigger any remote code to be downloaded (via $http)
then the guard does not put that into consideration. This fix now properly addresses
that circumstance and removes the guard once all outbound HTTP requests are complete
when an Angular application is bootstrapped.
